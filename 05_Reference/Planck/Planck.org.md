||**Planck Foundation advocates an Interdisciplinary Science Integration for achieving Global Sustainable Prosperity for all of mankind in the 21st century and beyond.  <br>  <br>Planck Foundation has a strong innovation focus (celebrating and exploring human intellect) and is by this rather anti-malthusian. Malthusianism is just driven by fear, not by science, innovation and celebration of life. Malthusianism ignores the continuous flow of technological progress by scientific research in its deep dark predictions (making malthusianism quite reactionary and certainly unscientific). With currently 3 billion people/minds online and 2 billion more people/minds to come online within a decade, developing and realizing solutions could go faster than ever before.**  <br>  <br>Unfortunately a lot of this innovation driven huge progress potential could be ruined by destruction caused by the collapse of unbalanced financial/monetary/state systems and furthermore by destruction caused by surveillance/tensions/imperialism/wars. Therefore developing innovation and achieving wisdom should go hand in hand.  <br>  <br>Planck Foundation channels loads of new data to scientists who are able to process/analyze fast/huge loads of information (i.e. being able to steer their ships in/on this flood) while producing future models based on all this data. Planck Foundation delivers out of these by integration of sciences delivered perspectives 21st century proof (aka sustainable) governmental and corporate strategies and models. Just the way Max Planck invited Albert Einstein to Berlin and gave him his platform, Planck Foundation is an interdisciplinary platform for today's brightest minds in those areas that could deliver paradigmatic changes for the 21st century.  <br>  <br>The current ‘zeitgeist’ in the science realm is too much influenced both by new dogmas and by an arrogance of 'we know everything yet’: This is a temperately ‘adolescence like’ development phase that science must go through, but one that blocks the further development of science enormously. Science is about ‘keep asking questions’. Science is about ‘the more you know the more you realize the less you know’. Science is much about ‘you don’t know what you don’t know yet’. Further development and dogmas/arrogance are contrary facets. The toxic cocktail made of new dogmas and new arrogance blocks the discovery of 'next level' (knowledge multiplying/widening/deepening) breakthroughs that characterized the elementary science thrust/boost/progress in the 18th and 19th century.  <br>  <br>A lot of this has to do with the massive institutionalization of science that took place. Huge paradigmatic breakthroughs are seldom born in large institutions. They mostly are born in the minds of individual scientists in combination with some (not scientific) luck and courage. The invention of penicillin is a very good example of both. Institutionalization (i.e. scale) and performance are contrary facets in discoveries. Even the size of budgets are the amount of discoveries are contrary facets.  <br>  <br>There are some gifted (often retired) scientists without budget nor institute who just by their own garage research understand more of the universe than whole institutions together. They often come (like Wegener: biologist who became geophysicist) from other science fields than their current major. One example: a retired US army weapon magnetism expert describes universe theories that just add up (way less flaws than in all present mainstream theories). These scientists need an audience, they need peer reviews of their models/theories. Major breakthroughs are mostly not born at institutions, but are the fruit of individual intellect fertilized by external information/theories.  <br>  <br>In science we need less of the second phase of Einstein (tame dogmas based institutionalization) and more of the somewhat forgotten Tesla (non dogmatic based wild ingenuity). Science has become (just like the politics) too heavily over-dogmatized and over-organized to perform as it could in delivering real new directions. Institutionalization leads to authority, authority leads to arrogance, arrogance leads to tightening of the mindset. The easy/cheap global communication the internet delivers to individual scientists is changing this at fast pace: asymmetric developments are ahead. The internet will push science fast forward again in a way the world witnessed end 19th century / start 20th century for the first time.<br><br>  <br><br>![This is what we get if we do Financial QE instead of Productive QE.](http://www.planck.org/images/640px-Zimbabwe_$100_trillion_2009_Obverse.jpg "This is what we get if we do Financial QE instead of Productive QE.")<br><br>  <br><br>_**Planck

the western world (USA and Europe) has peaked and is in decline (too much in debt, too spoiled and too old)<br>- the west should stop at once its denial of the economic (and by that financial and by that political) global changes<br>- economic systems with too much financial and too less production activities are bound to derail (credit has its limits)<br>- the west should divert its tax system asap from a labour based tax model towards a consumption based tax model<br>- nations with no real growth should smartly contract their governmental spending (as funding has entered dire straits)<br>- all nations should phase out all lobbyists driven governmental spending (as these don't serve national interest at all)<br>- bailing out financials is an example of lobbyists driven governmental spending (too big to fail is too big to exist)<br>- subsidizing sectors/companies is an example of lobbyists driven governmental spending (pollutes market function)<br>- waging wars is an example of lobbyists driven governmental spending (with huge negative economic/political impact too)<br>- war burdened economies don't build but consume economic progress (also impact export/imago/branding negative too)<br>- all lobbyists driven governmental spending towards special interests undermines structural the tax paying willingness<br>- Keynes' theories where developed in a time of almost zero governmental spending (current setting is quite different)<br>- monetizing governmental budget deficits (like USA and Europe do) is ordering financial/economic/governmental collapse<br>- the way out of monetizing governmental deficits is Energy focused/narrowed QE (builds instead of destructs the future)<br>- the west should restructure its energy models as they drain economies (away from oil/coal/gas towards geothermal)<br>- energy transition by subsidizing new energy sources pollutes energy markets (energy transition by finance models not)<br>- peakenergy/peakresources will eat out all efficiency growth in developed nations (gradual decline will replace growth)<br>- outsourcing of production eats out the economic future of nations (credit based growth has a limit and isn't sustainable)<br>- expensive energy/resources are the unknown triggers of the credit crunch (eating out the payment power of debtors)<br>- outsourcing production is another yet unknown credit crunch trigger (78% of the demand in the USA is consumer based)<br>- credit based 'growth' is the result of weak politics/leadership (as it is artificial growth and has a hard end point)<br>- low rates/conditions/ethics, deception/fraud, high bonuses and deregulation have ruined the financial system<br>- a wrong response to a ruined financial system ruins the financial status of governments/banks/pensionfunds further<br>- a comprehensive analysis of actual developments is needed to create the right response to a ruined financial system<br>- as growth is no the longer economic reality economic adulthood is the new reality (preserving wealth as main objective)<br>- as real growth was replaced by artificial credit based growth debt exploded the last 20 years in the advanced economies<br>- advanced economies can't grow themselves out of debt (as they have no real production based growth anymore)<br>- the credit driven artificial growth debt levels has become too high to service (the most artificial growth falls first)<br>- there's too much debt and too less real growth in the system (both are not easy to solve, but there is a work around)<br>- the solution of fighting debt with more debt will lead to hyperinflation (punishing those who have savings severely)<br>- the solution of fighting debt with write downs will lead to collapse of any financial asset (destroying all savings/pensions)<br>- currencies are mediums of exchange, not stable asset holdings (the financial industry is based on a wrong assumption)<br>- energy focused/narrowed quantitative easing will hedge the declining financial assets with the increasing energy assets<br>- energy focused/narrowed QE gives banks income while they adjust/contract (preventing financial system collapse)<br>- a money system that's based on growth will come in dire straits (as money for interest is only created by growth)<br>- without growth that creates money for interest payment banks will hit by insolvent debtors (mathematical certainty)<br>- switching from growth to stability delivers a critical moment (banks/pensionfunds can collapse by debtor insolvencies)<br>- collapses are contrary to stability and therefore need to be prevented (without enlarging the past at the future's cost)<br>- changing from growth to stability needs other total new/different policies (economic adulthood is a total new science)<br>- governments and households in developed nations has build up too much debt (no further growth possible: peakcapital)<br>- debtors want to inflate themselves out of debt and force other nations to do also (value attack: race to the bottom)<br>- those with savings/pensions want stable currency values and not give debtors a second free ride (value defence)<br>- inflation should be recognized as the invisible taxation of governments on wise private savings/pensions (value decline)<br>- inflation forces savings/pensions to high risk investments to maintain real assets values (brings risks into securities)<br>- peakcapital makes further credit based artificial consumption growth impossible in developed countries (credit top)<br>- the credit crunch will contract capital in reach (credit crunch will bring the capital -what's left of it- back home)<br>- the energy crunch will contract economies in reach (energy crunch will bring the jobs -what's left of them- back home)<br>- advanced countries are losing their headstart in the global economy (too expensive/old/retired/spoiled/undereducated)<br>- advanced countries overestimate their position/future due to neo-colonial thinking (subsequent damage by old visions)<br>- the political process is too much infected by corporate interests (there a need for an ethic reveille in politics)<br>- democracy and distance are inversely proportional (bigger distance to the voter delivers more pollution by corporatism)<br>- democracy in the west will decline due instability/corporatism (democracy in the east will grow due to growing stability)<br>- economic democracy will replenish parliamentary democracy substantial (consumers will vote by their purchase power)<br>- taxation should facilitate economic democracy (tax payer decides budget use: direct replaces parliamentary democracy)<br>- pensions should have a total mobility (making pension funds to pension providers: delivering pension democracy)<br>- developing nations can steer their economies into low-energy/high-growth directions (building is easier than changing)<br>- regardless the political system: any system without a corruption exposing press and/or institutes is bound to decline<br>- regardless the political system: any system with a 'revolving door' between market and government is bound to de-rail<br>- governments and corporations should not join forces together as such a huge power concentration will destroy wealth<br>- derivative financial capitalism destroys wealth and should be limited (by credit contraction and regulation expansion)<br>- industrial production capitalism creates wealth and should be stimulated (by credit expansion and regulation contraction)<br>- redistribution wealth doesn't create any wealth (wealth is created by work/innovation and conserved by legislation)<br>- empowering people is more effective wealth distribution of wealth (building facilities that make people strong)<br>- financial systems, pension systems and governmental bonds are by nature heading towards ponzi schemes brokeness<br>- as 48.5% of all households in the USA receive any type of government benefit you know main street is broke ([link](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/10/05/nearly-half-of-households-receive-some-government-benefit))<br>- parasitic wealth/power concentrations occur when governments are lazy regulators (free/fair markets need regulation)<br>- overpowered governments and overpowered corporations are the two mainstream roads that lead to main street serfdom<br>- independent people building their life and their environment need protection against governments and corporations<br>- left and right are no longer viable concepts (only the new third road can deliver prosperity in/for the 21st century)<br>- power/capital/media/trade/pharma/dna concentration and chemical/nuclear/gmo pollution are the only dangers we face<br>- energy/water/food/health problems will be solved down the road if we prevent those concentrations/pollutions<br>- as capital systems will go more local, economies will follow (the rise of local: E.F. Schumacher / F.W. Raiffeisen)<br>- as capital systems will more in more local direction, currencies will follow too (the rise of kWh based currencies)<br>- information and technology will always stay globalized (but will serve local capital/economies/currencies)<br>- both developing and developed nations need a comprehensive integration of economic/energy/monetary sciences<br><br>  <br>  <br>_**Planck Foundation advocates regarding monetary sciences:**_<br><br>- a gradual transformation of the banking system in OECD countries (from global to national as a response to peakcapital)<br>- a gradual phasing out of the fractional reserves based banking system in the OECD countries (1/1 leverage system)<br>- globalization of capital has proven to be more riskfull as expected (distance and safety have an inverse correlation)<br>- global banking corporations will become more national compartmentalized (national regulation, funding and branding)<br>- global banking corporations will abandon their unilabel/unibranding strategies (to prevent contamination at large)<br>- global banking corporations will have other listing/funding and market/retail names (to prevent contamination at large)<br>- global banking corporations will decline in number and size (operational windfalls are gone / head winds emerge)<br>- financial regulation will emerge to more simple yet significant tightened basic rational demands (less is more model)<br>- commercial influence on financial regulation will decline in most nations (the other nations will fall into chaos)<br>- the combo of privatizing profits and socializing debts will decline (political no longer acceptable without martial law)<br>- the socializing debts wave is on it's peak and will decline (political not longer possible in most nations)<br>- debt socialization will move back into it's former borders (special purpose vehicles around the central banks)<br>- but debt socialization by SPVs by central banks will become in dire straits too (more difficult in an information era)<br>- ratings by rating agencies have proven to be not valid at all (rating agencies delivered false security labelling)<br>- the risk factor of distance will be priced soon (a market driven method that will contract the reach of capital)<br>- the kWh will replace the dollar in all denominations for international trade/loans/settlements (as it's a stable value)<br>- no new global reserve currency is needed when the kWh denomination will be implemented (dehubbed/multipolar world)<br>- as power in kWh will be used for international settlements international power infra will become important<br>- EBS: energy backed securities should replace gold and reserve currencies (as energy is transportable)<br>- EBD: energy backed derivatives are much more safe than real estate CDOs (as they build out of controllable blocks)<br>- as the economies of the west decline the perspectives of both their governments and their banks turns gray<br>- taking all perspectives and future liabilities into account almost all governments of the west are technical broke<br>- taking all perspectives and future losses into account almost all banks of the west are technical broke<br>- as some governments are more broke than others, in the same way some banks are more broke than others<br>- a growth focused banking model will collapse without growth, not by ideology, but just by plain economics<br>- a growth focused governmental model will collapse without growth, not by ideology, but just by plain economics<br>- the west could prevent this decline attached collapse by using a set of wealth preserving strategies<br>- there are more effective wealth preserving strategies than soft (grants based) and/or hard (war based) imperialism<br>- the financial power (and by that direct also the geopolitical power) will swift from the west/north to the east/side<br>- high cost banks will lose their business to new low cost financial providers (like facebook, google and telcos)<br>- banks need a new income/business model as current revenues/marketshares are declining (by writedowns/competition)<br>- most reported bank profits are inflated and full of thin air (reports are made for bonuses and mainly ignore most risks)<br>- a model that delivers banks time to contract in size/costs without collapsing (banks as energy focused QE distributors)<br>- a model that reforms the financial sector behaviour and that way it's image (without friends no customers for banks)<br>- an instant transformation of the monetary system (money creation back to governments: fixing all budget/tax issues)<br>- voluminous full energy focused quantitative easing (delivering banks a compromise on the money creation withdrawal)<br>- legalization of comparative currencies within a nation (governments delivers growth/decline of currency trust/demand)<br>- smaller governments with severely contracted financial demands (leaving more purchase power into the real economy)<br>- an analysis of war as the ultimate negative economic influence (no prosperity production, just a waste of resources)<br>- an analysis of war as 'the solution of last resort' (failed governments without any other perspective for their nations)<br>- a swift from taxation of labour/profits towards taxation of consumption (transition from debt to assets based

cycles (larger solar periods)<br>- there's a direct correlation between sunactivity/sunspots and acid rain (by the intensity/volume of evaporation/rain)<br>- there's a correlation between sunactivity and earthpolar ozone holes (more cold turns O3 quicker back into O2) ([NASA](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=60598))<br>- as sun gauss data is just an expression of the solar activity: the 21st century could be a cold/dry/dusty/acid one<br>- in solar super cycle minima the sky has in the summers more clouds (less sun) and in the winters less cloud (more cold)<br>- the sun generate solar energy (SE), generate solar neutrinos (SN), and discharge waste products in the solar wind (SW)<br>- earth's core/mantle activities are moderated by cosmic rays (aka by the journey of the solar system in the universe)<br>- earth quake frequency/intensity is equally proportional with the easy to measure sun's poles gauss values<br>- microdust levels are equally proportional with sun's pole gauss values (due to less rain / more cosmic dust enterance)<br>- microdust levels an in low sunspot years double than regular (in 2011 total year values are already reached in May)<br>- sunspots/sungauss values direct effects food prices and by this inflation, economic developments, GDP and civil unrest<br>- sunspots/sungauss values direct effects sun based energy models like PV, CPS and wind (wind indirect is sun driven too)<br>- many elements are formed by the nuclear processes in the earth's inner mantle (science neglects earth's core/mantle)<br>- the location of our solar system in the Milky Way determines the climate on earth (drives cores/mantles of sun/earth)<br>- if the sun is in a hibernation period the ionosphere and the van allen belts are less strong (delivering less protection)<br>- the magnetosphere is not that much stable as we thought is was (breaches in it leaks more solar wind to earth) ([NASA](http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/16dec_giantbreach))<br>- less protection delivers more cosmic radiation and more cosmic dust (clouds will mature more difficult: more water vapor)<br>- more cosmic radiation and more cosmic dust deliver too much rain drop 'seeds': more clouds and less rain ([Kirkby \| CERN](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1181073))<br>- less cloud maturing = more clouds = less sunlight = less evaporation (and by that less rain/dew) and less photosynthesis<br>- more incoming cosmic dust/radiation will cause more rain at sea and less rain onshore (changing hydrological system)<br>- ocean currents, jet streams and storms are (besides by other factors) also driven by magnetic fields changes<br>- this explains the unlogical air pressure phenomenon (dry air delivers higher pressure, wet air delivers lower pressure)<br>- earth's core/mantle contributes to the global temperature by warming oceans (different depth temperature land/ocean)<br>- earth's core/mantle contributes to the global temperature by CH4 emission into the atmosphere (CH4+2O2=CO2+2H2O)<br>- earth's core/mantle CH4 production is responsible for the massive amount of water on earth (CH4+2O2=CO2+2H2O)<br>- there's a direct link between sun activity (measured in sunspot frequency/sizes) and earthquakes (cosmic rays/gravity)<br>- there's a direct link between the journey of our solar system in the universe and earthquakes (cosmic rays/gravity)<br>- geothermal energy is harvesting the heat of the nuclear decay/fission/fusion processes in the earth's core/mantle<br>- geothermal energy can be easily harvested on the hotspots in the earth's crust (limitless, endless and riskless)<br>- both cosmic gravity and the combination of cosmic radiation and the ionosphere influence core/mantle/magma behavior<br>- the sun is an unstable remain of a supernova that exploded ~5 Gyr ago and gave birth to the solar system ([image](http://www.planck.org/images/origin-solar-system.jpg)) (link)<br>- Kuroda/Myers combined Th/U/Pu age dating shows that a supernova made our actinide elements ~5 Gyr years ago ([link](http://www.omatumr.com/Data/1994Data.htm))<br>- nuclear repulsion is the core power source of the sun (solution 33% expected neutrinos emission mistery) ([O. Manuel](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1499v1))<br>- neutron repulsion powers the sun for 60%: so the sun is not only a hydrogen fusion reactor ([link](http://news.mst.edu/2003/03/research_suggests_neutron_repu.html))<br>- the sun's hydrogen is generated as the 'smoke' of the core's neutron replusion process (so NR is the basic process)<br>- the sun's hydrogen fusion occurs in the outer magnetic field of the sun and not in it's core ([LANL](http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/astro-ph/0512633.pdf))<br>- the volume of a neutron increases by about a factor of ~(10)^23 when it goes from the solar core to become H atom<br>- the mass to energy convertion through neutron repulsion is greater than for uranium fission or hydrogen fusion<br>- neutron emission from the sun's core triggers a series of reactions that generate the sun's characteristics<br>- neutron emission from the sun's core deliver luminosity, solar neutrinos and an outflow of hydrogen in the solar wind<br>- the sun’s corona's excess temperatures are caused by the continuous collision with / bombardment of cosmic particles<br>- the core of the sun is hidden inside a mantle made mostly of Fe that's covered with a surface veneer of H<br>- the core of the sun emits as 'smoke' neutrons (which quickly decay to H) (solving the solar neutrino mystery)<br>- the sun's core is a neutron star ([Toth in Nature in 1977](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5633/abs/270159a0.html)), neutron repulsion is the key process of the sun (Manuel)<br>- the sun has not a stable 'climate' ([link to NASA discovery of 2010](http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/13dec_globaleruption%20target=))<br>- neutron repulsion is restrained by competition between attractive forces of gravity and repulsive forces of neutrons<br>- the sun's neutron emission generates 60% SE<br>- the sun's neutron decay to hydrogen produces 5% SE and 90% SW<br>- the sun's hydrogen fusion to helium generates 35% SE and 10% SW<br>- the sun discharge waste products to interstellar space is 100% SW<br>- when a neutron goes from the compact solar core it become an interstellar atom of hydrogen<br>- the entire cosmos is composed of two forms of one fundamental particle: the neutron and the hydrogen atom<br>- the organic/recycling/energy universe (matter = just energy, some sections are contracting and some are expanding)<br>- gravitational redshift could be the result of huge orbits of static clusters (Robinsons alternative for the Doppler effect)<br>- huge orbits of static clusters can explain apparently straight lines (the earth time perspectives/window is limited)<br>- the universe and every atom in it can be represented by cyclic, reversible transitions between those two forms<br>- trade winds = earth's magnetic field driven = earth’s core and sun’s core driven = milky way driven = universe driven<br><br>  <br>  <br>_**Planck Foundation advocates regarding agricultural sciences:**_<br><br>- air is 78% N: N out of the air binding bacteria on co/between flora (or on host powder) will supply all agri N demand<br>- haber-bosch process N fertilizer will become almost obsolute before 2025 (lowering global natural gas demand severely)<br>- only by/after sowing a little N fertilizer will be applied, resulting in a huge cost reduction in agriculture<br>- the use of rock flour as flora micro nutrient fertilizer will boom the next decade: it's very cheap and very effective<br>- the last time the world was fertilized this way was during the last ice age (when freezing released dust from rocks)<br>- no-till farming will boost by this too: the root system of the co/between crops will deliver soil structure and drainage<br>- only tractor tracks will be tilled before each new crop cycle, resulting in a huge cost reduction in agriculture<br>- no-till farming noty only give cost benefits, it also improves soil quality and water shortness/access regulation<br>- due to other fertilizer and tilling approaches the cost price of agriculture will drop significantly<br>- desert greening by seawater irrigation and salt water staple crops (halophytes) will double global food production<br>- the halophyte salicornia will replace GMO/glyphosate based soy and tropical woods ruining based palm (proteins/fats)<br>- malthus his dark global food shortages/prices predictions made in 1798 are proven false for 220 years long now<br>- malthusianism left the engineer (science) out of its equations: delivering a total false result (it's a believe, not science)<br>- biophysics based flora grow/defence technology (physics will compete massive with chemics and genetics) ([link](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/11-0455.1))<br>- biosymbiosis based flora defence technology (use of sub flora to activate the immune system of the main crop)<br>- biosymbiosis based flora fertilizer technology (use of sub flora to fertilize the grow process of the main crop)<br>- biosymbiosis based flora water technology (use of sub flora to harvest more dew as micro irrigation for the main crop)<br>- biosymbiosis based flora soil technology (use of sub flora to improve soil biological/chemical quality and structure)<br>- intercropping (use of sub flora for soil structure, chemical/biological quality, soil protection and dew harvesting)<br>- artificial biodiversity by several different crops in abreast rows in fields (prevents/represses monoculture problems)<br>- the initiation of decentralized DNA preserving gardens as far as possible (preventing centralized DNA storage/powers)<br>- an open DNA database where public domain DNA is listed (preventing patent warriors to patent natural existing DNA)<br>- a total ban on patenting any DNA (as natural/public DNA currently massively is transferred to the proprietary domain)<br>- decentral seed policies/knowledge/corporations (for preventing concentrated DNA power and attached monocultures)<br>- big corporate seed concentrations are the biggest treat for global food production (as they undermine nature's diversity)<br>- heterogene local/regional seed cultivation is the best way to maintain the DNA bandwidth of global food production<br>- local/regional seed cultivation's diversity is the best insurance against a sudden collapse of global food production<br>- the combination of biosymbiosis, intercropping and decentral seed structures deliver maximal agricultural biodiversity<br>- 'golden rice' and the 'orange banana' are useless PR products of gentech (just eating a carrot delivers more carotene)<br>- intercropping by flora that can bind N out of the air into the soil (an energy free on location fertilizer)<br>- intercropping by flora that stimulates the defence mechanism of main crops (reduce the demand for chemical protection<br>- algae/bacteria focused research that can bind N out of the air into the soil (energy free local fertilizer) ([link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_%28genus%29))<br>- replacement of ploughing by less deep loosening (keeps soil surface bio more vital to support growth/defence)<br>- promotion of new agricultural commodities delivers crop diversification (wider crop cycles reduce chemical use severely)<br>- sunflower/rapa can replace soy for oil, nettles/hemp can replace cotton for fibers, lupin can replace soy for protein<br>- the use of algae as a new agricultural resource (fast growth of high quality food oils on natural salt water surfaces)<br>- the use of duckweed as a new agricultural resource (fast growth of high quality proteins on sweet water surfaces)<br>- the use of seaweed as a new agricultural resource (fast growth of high quality proteins/carbons on salt water surfaces)<br>- commercial aquaculture duckweed farming will recover phosphates out of waste water before they flows to sea<br>- current waste water models are disposing phosphorus for ever for the food chain (DNA in each cell is made of P)<br>- sunspot quantity has a direct effect on global food price levels and by this on civil unrest caused by high food prices<br>- connection roads attached smart suburbanization to maintain rural biodiversity (gardens deliver artificial biodiversity)<br>- connection roads attached smart suburbanization to re-establish wildlife corridors (gardens deliver artificial corridors)<br>- smart suburbanization to keep rural areas economic viable (cities have structural energy and food deficits)<br>- less pesticides use + more biodiversity help to restore the
