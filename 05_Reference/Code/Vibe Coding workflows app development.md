Like many enterprise application platform vendors, [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) has been on a journey over the past year to bring the power of agentic AI to users.

The company first introduced AI agents in its [Xanadu platform release](https://venturebeat.com/ai/servicenow-introduces-a-library-of-enterprise-ai-agents-you-can-customize-to-fit-your-workflow) in 2024, The initial release enabled companies to build, test and deploy generative AI skills and prompts that can be assigned to AI agents. Today ServiceNow is out with its latest platform iteration as part of the company's Zurich release.

The update, available to current ServiceNow customers bundled with certain plans, introduces three major capabilities designed to move enterprises from AI experimentation to production deployment: **natural language app building through vibe coding,** enterprise-grade AI security consoles and autonomous workflow automation.

The timing addresses a critical enterprise bottleneck. While companies have invested in AI pilots, many still struggle to scale these projects beyond individual departments. Gartner predicts 60% of enterprises will adopt AI agent development platforms by 2029. ServiceNow is positioning itself to capture this transition in a very competitive space.

### Vibe coding not for hobbyists but for enterprise applications

[Vibe coding](https://venturebeat.com/ai/everyones-looking-to-get-in-on-vibe-coding-and-google-is-no-different-with-stitch-its-follow-up-to-jules) has been an emerging paradigm over the past few years, enabling users to build entire applications with natural language prompts. Multiple vendors are in the space including Cognition, Bolt, Lovable and Replit. ServiceNow is now entering the space, with a specific focus on enterprise workflow application enablement.

ServiceNow's new Build Agent transforms simple English commands into production-ready enterprise applications. Tell it "create an onboarding app that assigns tasks to HR, IT and Facilities" and it builds the entire system in minutes. 

Like other enterprise IT platforms, ServiceNow has had low-code capabilities for years, providing users with the ability to assemble applications without code. The new Build Agent is something a bit different.

Build Agent performs comprehensive testing, handles version control and ensures compliance with enterprise standards. Every application includes audit trails, security controls and governance checking built-in. The platform leverages ServiceNow's 20-year accumulation of enterprise workflow data. This institutional knowledge helps AI agents understand business context automatically.

"In a matter of minutes, the Build Agent not only got the requirements, looked through all the aspects of building, found the errors before deploying, debugged it and also pushed the app into production, " Jithin Bhasker, global vice president and general manager of creator workflows at ServiceNow explained during a demo with press.

### New security consoles built for enterprise AI scale

Another common pitfall that can significantly impact enterprise agentic AI deployments is security. To that end, ServiceNow's Zurich release introduces two entirely new security consoles specifically designed for enterprise AI deployment.

The new Machine Identity Console monitors all API connections and automatically flags high-risk integrations. The system automatically flags accounts inactive for over 100 days and identifies weak authentication methods like basic authentication.

"Machine identity console identifies any high risk integrations and provides a guided experience for our customers to help them improve the security," Amanda Grady, vice president and general manager of AI platform security explained in a press briefing.

ServiceNow also launched the new Vault Console, which builds on vault capabilities the company introduced in its [Tokyo release](https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/servicenow-evolves-from-itsm-aims-to-simplify-business-processes) two years ago. The enhanced console uses AI to discover sensitive data across workflows and applies protection policies automatically

 "Now not only do you have humans and machines accessing the data, but now we also have AI agents accessing the data," Grady said during the briefing.

These new security capabilities build on ServiceNow's existing [AI Control Tower,](https://venturebeat.com/ai/servicenow-lets-users-see-more-of-their-ai) which the company announced in May 2025. The Control Tower provides enterprise-wide visibility and governance for AI systems. The new consoles extend this governance specifically to API integrations and data protection.

ServiceNow treats AI agents as a distinct identity type requiring specialized protocols.

 "We consider AI agents to really be a new type of identity, distinct from humans and distinct from machines," Grady noted.

### Market position against platform giants

ServiceNow's unified approach directly challenges Microsoft and Salesforce's low-code and agentic AI tools. 

The key differentiator is the platform itself and integration with the existing ServiceNow enterprise workflows. The company's 20-year accumulation of enterprise workflow data provides a significant competitive advantage and gravity for existing users.

This institutional knowledge helps AI agents understand business context automatically. The enhanced process mining identifies automation opportunities instead of requiring manual discovery.

"We want to make sure that all the inefficiencies the customers have today can be solved by agentic scenarios," Nirankush Panchbhai, Senior vice president of AI platform at ServiceNow commented during the press briefing.

### Why this matters for enterprise strategy

ServiceNow's Zurich release forces a fundamental strategic choice: platform consolidation versus best-of-breed AI tools. The company is betting that enterprises will choose integration simplicity over vendor flexibility.

The evidence suggests this bet may pay off. Tasks requiring weeks of development work now complete in minutes, according to ServiceNow. More importantly, the platform eliminates the integration complexity that kills many enterprise AI projects before they reach production scale.

The strategic question for enterprises becomes: accept platform lock-in for operational simplicity, or maintain vendor flexibility while managing integration complexity internally? For most organizations struggling to move beyond AI pilots, ServiceNow's unified approach may prove decisive.

The market signal is clear. As Panchbhai noted, enterprises are "pivoting from legacy automations to proactive automations across all workflows." Organizations still building point AI solutions with tools from multiple vendors may find themselves architecturally disadvantaged if the industry consolidates around integrated platforms.

# Stop sending anonymous texts. Start building trust.

When your bank sends a fraud alert from an unknown number, do you click the link without hesitation? When your favorite retailer texts about a sale, can you be sure it's really them and not a scammer?

In a world where fraudsters can mimic real brands down to the logo and tone of voice, every unexpected text forces customers into a split-second judgment call: trust it, ignore it, or block it. When that decision happens dozens of times a week, customers start choosing the safest route — tuning out anything that isn’t trusted, relevant, or personalized.

This creates a massive problem for legitimate businesses. Even well-intentioned messages risk being treated as noise, or worse, as threats. In interactions where trust is key, a plain text from an unknown number no longer feels convenient; it might feel like a red flag.

### Why traditional SMS falls short

Not long ago, businesses relied on SMS as their go-to channel: it was quick, universal, and worked on any device. But while SMS stood still, other channels raced ahead. Email added logos, colors, and interactive features. Apps brought rich media and two-way conversations. SMS now feels a bit generic.

The stakes are particularly high in industries where trust is non-negotiable. A financial institution sending unverified texts undermines its own security efforts. A healthcare provider using anonymous SMS loses the confidence it works to build with patients. Even in retail, the gap between a verified, branded message and a generic blast can mean the difference between a sale and a missed opportunity.

Familiarity alone can't carry trust anymore. Every interaction needs to signal safety, authenticity, and care — starting with the very first message a customer receives.

### What rich communication services (RCS) makes possible

[Rich Communication Services (RCS)](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging/channels/rcs) is designed for this moment. Instead of unfamiliar phone numbers, messages arrive with clear brand presence: a verified sender's name, a recognizable logo, and familiar, structured layouts with tappable buttons, cards, maps, or product carousels.

It's not about adding fluff. It's about making it obvious who's reaching out and giving people simple ways to take action. For example, a delivery update arrives with a live map, a "reschedule" button, and a "contact support" option — all in the same message thread. No app download required. No login needed. It's personalized, useful, and above all, trusted.

When messaging works like this, it shifts from being a one-way alert to a channel people want to use, driving faster responses, more actions, and stronger loyalty.

### What the data tells us

Verified, rich messaging delivers strategic business outcomes. According to the [Twilio 2025 State of](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/state-of-customer-engagement) [Customer Engagement Report](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/state-of-customer-engagement), 75% of business leaders plan to invest in RCS this year. Meanwhile, 61% of consumers express concern that brands don't use their data in their best interest, revealing a critical trust gap that verified rich messaging helps close.

Take [Fresha](https://customers.twilio.com/en-us/fresha), a beauty and wellness booking platform serving over 130,000 salons worldwide. After adopting RCS messaging through Twilio, Fresha saw immediate lifts in trust and engagement across appointment communications. The results speak for themselves: it's less about the words in the message and more about how it's delivered — in a clear, branded format customers recognize at a glance.

### The infrastructure is already here

The capability to deliver these experiences exists today. Android has supported RCS for years, and with iOS adding RCS compatibility, reach now spans both major platforms. Enterprises don't need to overhaul their systems — RCS can be configured through existing communications platforms like Twilio and deployed without code changes.

Customers expect this level of experience. The infrastructure is in place. The only question is whether businesses will meet the moment.

### Building trust through every message

The inbox is no longer a neutral space — it's an extension of your brand. If your message arrives and feels questionable, everything that follows loses credibility, no matter how well designed or timed.

In my work leading product development for customer engagement, I've seen how expectations evolve. Customers expect personalization, but also privacy. They want speed, but also security. Most of all, they want to communicate with a real brand, not a bot or faceless system.

Verified rich messaging delivers on all these expectations without adding complexity. It combines brand identity, functionality, and trust in a format people already know how to use.

The end of anonymous business texts isn't a disruption, it's a course correction. Trust must be visible, not implied. Confirmed, not assumed. When brands use RCS, they signal they value customer trust and loyalty, not just their business.
