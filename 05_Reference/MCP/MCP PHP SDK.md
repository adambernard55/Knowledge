The official PHP SDK for Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides a framework-agnostic API for implementing MCP servers in PHP.

Currently, we are still in the process of merging [Symfony's MCP SDK](https://github.com/symfony/mcp-sdk) and [PHP-MCP](https://github.com/php-mcp) components. Not all code paths are fully tested or complete, and this package may still contain duplicate functionality or dead code.

If you want to help us stabilize the SDK, please see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk/issues).

This project is a collaboration between [the PHP Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/) and the [Symfony project](https://symfony.com/). It adopts development practices and standards from the Symfony project, including [Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) and the [Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).

Until the first major release, this SDK is considered [experimental](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html).
