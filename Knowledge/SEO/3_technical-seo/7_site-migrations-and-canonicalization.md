# Site Migrations and Canonicalization: Managing URLs and Preserving SEO Value

## Overview

**Canonicalization** is the process of selecting the single, authoritative URL for a piece of content that can be accessed through multiple addresses. **Site migrations** are large-scale changes to a website's structure, domain, or platform that involve changing many URLs at once.

Together, these two concepts are at the heart of managing URL identity and preserving SEO equity during periods of change. A poorly executed migration can be catastrophic for organic traffic, while a solid canonicalization strategy prevents duplicate content issues and consolidates ranking signals.

This guide covers the principles of canonicalization and provides a structured framework for planning and executing a successful site migration with minimal SEO risk.

## 1. Canonicalization: Solving the Duplicate Content Problem

### 1.1 What is a Canonical URL?
A canonical URL is the URL of the page that you want search engines to treat as the primary version. When multiple pages have identical or very similar content, the canonical tag tells search engines which one to index and rank.

Common causes of duplicate content include:
-   HTTP vs. HTTPS versions (`http://example.com` vs. `https://example.com`)
-   WWW vs. non-WWW versions (`www.example.com` vs. `example.com`)
-   URLs with tracking parameters (`example.com/page?source=email`)
-   Printer-friendly versions of pages
-   Content syndicated to other sites

### 1.2 The `rel="canonical"` Tag
The most common way to specify a canonical URL is with the `rel="canonical"` link tag in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

**Example:**
On the page `https://example.com/page?id=123`, the canonical tag would point to the clean version:
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page" />
````

### 1.3 Why Canonicalization is Important

- **Consolidates Link Signals:** It combines the value from multiple duplicate URLs into a single, authoritative URL.
- **Prevents Keyword Cannibalization:** It stops multiple pages from competing against each other for the same keywords.
- **Manages Syndicated Content:** It allows you to syndicate content to other sites while ensuring the original article gets the SEO credit.
- **Improves Crawl Efficiency:** It tells search engines which pages to focus on, saving crawl budget.

### 1.4 Best Practices for Canonicalization

1. **Be Absolute:** Always use absolute URLs (e.g., `https://www.example.com/page`), not relative URLs (`/page`).
2. **Be Accurate:** The canonical URL must point to a page with genuinely duplicate or highly similar content.
3. **Self-Reference:** It is a best practice for a page to have a self-referencing canonical tag (e.g., the canonical tag on `https://example.com/page` points to itself).
4. **Use Only One Method:** Do not mix signals (e.g., setting one canonical in the sitemap and another in the HTML).

## 2. Site Migrations: A Framework for Managing Change

A site migration is any event where a website undergoes substantial changes that can affect search engine visibility. This is one of the riskiest activities in SEO.

### 2.1 Types of Site Migrations

|Migration Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Protocol Change**|Moving from HTTP to HTTPS.|
|**Domain Name Change**|Moving from `old-brand.com` to `new-brand.com`.|
|**Subdomain/Subfolder Change**|Restructuring site architecture, e.g., moving a blog from `blog.example.com` to `example.com/blog`.|
|**CMS/Platform Change**|Moving from one content management system to another (e.g., Drupal to WordPress). Often results in URL changes.|
|**Site Redesign**|A major change in design, content, and structure, even if URLs remain the same.|

### 2.2 The SEO Risk of Site Migrations

Without proper planning, a migration can lead to:

- Severe traffic and ranking loss.
- Loss of link equity due to broken redirects.
- An increase in `404` errors.
- Indexing issues and duplicate content.

### 2.3 The SEO Site Migration Checklist

A successful migration follows a three-phase process: pre-migration, launch, and post-migration.

#### Phase 1: Pre-Migration (Planning)

1. **Crawl the Existing Site:** Use a tool like **Screaming Frog** or **Sitebulb** to create a complete list of all URLs, titles, meta descriptions, and headers. This is your baseline.
2. **Benchmark Performance:** Record key metrics before the migration: rankings for top keywords, organic traffic levels, and conversion rates.
3. **Create a 301 Redirect Map:** This is the most critical step. Create a spreadsheet that maps every old URL to its corresponding new URL. This ensures all link equity is passed from the old pages to the new ones.
4. **Review the New Site:** Crawl the staging or development version of the new site. Check for broken links, incorrect canonicals, and ensure `noindex` tags are not present.
5. **Update Internal Links:** All internal links on the new site should point to the new URL structure, not the old ones.

#### Phase 2: During Migration (Launch)

1. **Choose a Low-Traffic Period:** Launch the migration during a time of day or day of the week when traffic is lowest to minimize user disruption.
2. **Implement 301 Redirects:** Deploy the 301 redirect map from the old URLs to the new ones.
3. **Update Sitemaps:** Submit the new XML sitemap(s) to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
4. **Update `robots.txt`:** Ensure the `robots.txt` file on the new site is not blocking important resources.
5. **Use the Change of Address Tool:** If you are changing your domain, use the Change of Address tool in Google Search Console.

#### Phase 3: Post-Migration (Monitoring)

1. **Crawl Both Old and New URLs:** Crawl the list of old URLs to ensure all are redirecting correctly. Crawl the new site to check for `404` errors or other issues.
2. **Monitor Google Search Console:** Watch the "Pages" (Coverage) and "Redirects" reports for any spikes in errors.
3. **Monitor Rankings and Traffic:** Track your benchmarked keywords and organic traffic levels. Some fluctuation is normal, but a sustained drop indicates a problem.
4. **Monitor Server Logs:** Analyze server logs to see how Googlebot is crawling the new site and if it is encountering any issues.
5. **Update Backlinks:** Reach out to the most valuable external sites that link to your old URLs and ask them to update their links.

## 3. Tools for Migrations and Canonicalization Audits

|Tool|Key Use Case|
|---|---|
|**Google Search Console**|Essential for monitoring index status, crawl errors, and submitting sitemaps. The URL Inspection Tool is critical for checking canonicalization.|
|**Site Crawlers (Screaming Frog, Sitebulb)**|The workhorse for creating URL inventories, checking redirects, auditing canonical tags, and finding broken links.|
|**Ahrefs / SEMrush / Moz**|Useful for benchmarking pre-migration performance, tracking keyword rankings, and identifying top pages by backlinks to prioritize.|
|**Spreadsheet Software (Google Sheets, Excel)**|The most important tool for creating and managing your 301 redirect map.|

## 4. Key Takeaways

1. **Canonicalization is proactive; site migrations are a major event.** Master canonicals to prevent daily duplicate content issues, and master migrations to survive major site changes.
2. The **`rel="canonical"` tag** is your primary tool for telling search engines which URL is the authoritative version.
3. A **301 redirect map** is the single most critical document in a site migration. Every old URL must be mapped to a relevant new URL.
4. **Thorough planning and monitoring are non-negotiable.** The work done before and after a migration is just as important as the work done on launch day.
5. Use a combination of **Google Search Console and a site crawler** to get a complete picture of your site's URL structure and health.
