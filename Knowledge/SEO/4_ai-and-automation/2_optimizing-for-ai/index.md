# Optimizing for AI

This section covers the strategic shift required to succeed in a search landscape dominated by AI. The documents here focus on how to optimize your content not just for traditional crawlers and human readers, but for the new audience of autonomous AI agents and generative answer engines.

**A Note on Terminology:** The industry is currently in a dynamic phase of naming this new discipline, with terms like **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**, **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**, and **AI SEO** all being used. While the final term may evolve, the core principle remains the same: optimizing for a world where AI-driven "information engines" are a primary channel for discovery.
