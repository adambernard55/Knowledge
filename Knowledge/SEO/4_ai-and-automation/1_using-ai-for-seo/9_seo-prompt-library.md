# SEO Prompt Library for AI Chatbots

## Overview

This document serves as a practical library of prompts for using AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude to accelerate common SEO tasks. These prompts are designed to be starting points that you can adapt and refine for your specific needs.

The effectiveness of any prompt depends on providing clear context, defining a role for the AI, and specifying the desired output. For a deeper understanding of the principles behind these examples, please refer to our guide on [[advanced-prompt-engineering|Advanced Prompt Engineering]].

## 1. Keyword Research

### Generate Seed Keywords
> **Why it's useful:** Quickly brainstorm a broad list of starting points for a new topic.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "I am creating a content strategy for a company that sells sustainable, eco-friendly yoga mats. Act as an expert SEO strategist and generate a list of 20 seed keywords that cover the main topics and subtopics related to this product. Group them into categories like 'product features', 'materials', 'user benefits', and 'comparisons'."

### Create Keyword Clusters
> **Why it's useful:** Group a messy list of keywords into thematic clusters to plan your content hubs.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Here is a list of keywords. Group them into semantically related clusters based on user intent. For each cluster, suggest a primary topic and a potential content format (e.g., blog post, landing page, comparison guide).
>
> Keywords:
> - eco friendly yoga mat
> - best non-toxic yoga mat
> - cork yoga mat vs rubber
> - how to clean a cork yoga mat
> - buy sustainable yoga mat
> - natural rubber yoga mat reviews"

### Find Long-Tail and Question-Based Keywords
> **Why it's useful:** Uncover high-intent, low-competition queries that are perfect for blog content and FAQ sections.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "For the primary topic 'sustainable yoga mats', generate a list of 15 long-tail keywords that a potential customer might ask. Frame at least 10 of them as direct questions (e.g., 'What is the most eco-friendly material for a yoga mat?')."

## 2. On-Page SEO and Content Creation

### Generate Title Tags and Meta Descriptions
> **Why it's useful:** Quickly create multiple compelling options for your page metadata to improve CTR.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Act as an expert SEO copywriter. For a blog post titled 'The Top 5 Benefits of a Cork Yoga Mat', write 5 unique title tag options (under 60 characters) and 3 unique meta description options (under 160 characters). The target keyword is 'benefits of cork yoga mat'. The tone should be informative and encouraging."

### Create a Content Outline
> **Why it's useful:** Build a structured, SEO-friendly outline for a new piece of content.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Create a detailed content outline for a blog post targeting the keyword 'how to choose a yoga mat'. The outline should include a logical H1, H2, and H3 structure. Include sections that cover material types, thickness, texture, and budget. Also, add a section for an FAQ based on common user questions."

### Rephrase Content for Readability
> **Why it's useful:** Simplify complex sentences and improve the overall flow of your content.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Rewrite the following paragraph to be more concise and improve its readability. Aim for a 9th-grade reading level and use active voice.
>
> Original Paragraph:
> 'The proliferation of various materials in the manufacturing of yoga mats has resulted in a situation where consumers are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer number of available options, making the ultimate purchase decision a complex and often confusing endeavor.'"

## 3. Technical SEO

### Generate Schema Markup
> **Why it's useful:** Quickly create the JSON-LD code for common schema types without manual coding.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Act as a technical SEO expert. Generate the JSON-LD schema markup for an `FAQPage`. Use the following questions and answers:
>
> Q1: What is a cork yoga mat?
> A1: A cork yoga mat is made from the bark of cork oak trees, a renewable and sustainable resource.
>
> Q2: Are cork yoga mats slippery?
> A2: Cork yoga mats have excellent grip, which actually increases when they get wet."

### Create `robots.txt` Rules
> **Why it's useful:** Generate the correct syntax for `robots.txt` directives to control crawler access.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Create the `robots.txt` rules to achieve the following:
> 1. Block all crawlers from the `/admin/` directory.
> 2. Block Googlebot specifically from the `/private-staging/` directory.
> 3. Allow all crawlers to access the rest of the site.
> 4. Include a link to the sitemap at `https://example.com/sitemap.xml`."

### Generate `hreflang` Tags
> **Why it's useful:** Avoid syntax errors when creating `hreflang` tags for international SEO.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Generate the `hreflang` link tags for a page that exists in the following versions:
> - English (for a global audience): `https://example.com/en/page`
> - German (for Germany): `https://example.com/de-de/page`
> - French (for France): `https://example.com/fr-fr/page`
>
> Include the `x-default` tag pointing to the English version."

## 4. Link Building and Outreach

### Brainstorm Linkable Assets
> **Why it's useful:** Generate creative ideas for content that is designed to attract backlinks.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Act as a digital PR strategist. For a company that sells eco-friendly yoga products, brainstorm 5 ideas for linkable assets. For each idea, briefly describe the asset and the type of website that would be likely to link to it. Examples could include a data-driven study, an interactive tool, or a comprehensive guide."

### Draft Outreach Emails
> **Why it's useful:** Create a personalized and effective template for your link-building outreach campaigns.
>
> **Prompt:**
> "Draft a concise and friendly email template for a broken link-building campaign.
>
> - My Name: [Your Name]
> - My Website: [Your Website Name]
> - Broken Link URL: [The URL of the broken link on their site]
> - Their Website Name: [Target Website Name]
> - My Replacement Resource: A comprehensive guide on [Your Topic], located at [Your URL].
>
> The tone should be helpful, not demanding. The goal is to inform them of the broken link and suggest my resource as a useful replacement."
