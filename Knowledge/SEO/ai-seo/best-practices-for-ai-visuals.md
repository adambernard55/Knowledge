Ethical Considerations & Best Practices for AI Visuals (25-35 mins)

This crucial lesson shifts focus to the responsible use of AI in visual content creation. It expands on the initial ethical points raised in Lesson 1.3 and Lesson 3.1, providing a detailed framework for navigating the ethical and legal landscape of AI-generated images and videos. You will learn about copyright complexities, strategies for addressing bias, methods for preventing misinformation (including deepfakes), and the vital importance of transparency and disclosure. The lesson emphasizes your responsibility as the human marketer â€“ the "strategic conductor" and ethical gatekeeper. Practical workbook activities will help you apply these best practices. This aligns with the broader ethical considerations that will be revisited in Module 6.

**Lesson 3.3 Learning Objectives:** By the end of this lesson and its associated workbook activities, you will be able to:

- Explain the complexities and evolving legal landscape surrounding copyright and intellectual property ownership of AI-generated visuals.

- Identify potential sources of bias in AI image/video models and outputs and apply mitigation strategies through prompt refinement and critical review.

- Recognize the dangers of misinformation and deepfakes created with AI visuals and commit to principles for avoiding deceptive content.

- Understand the importance of transparency and disclosure regarding the use of AI-generated visuals in marketing and recommend appropriate methods (e.g., hashtags, explicit statements) based on context.

- Apply best practices for critically reviewing AI-generated images and videos to ensure they are ethical, accurate, and free from harmful bias.

- Analyze real-world ethical dilemmas related to AI visuals through workbook case studies.

## 1. Welcome & Introduction

"Welcome back. In Lessons 3.1 and 3.2, we explored the incredible creative power of AI for images and videos. But as this technology advances, so does our responsibility to use it ethically. Today, we're focusing on exactly that: how to be responsible creators when using these powerful visual tools. We'll cover copyright, bias, misinformation, and transparency. Remember, I'm Link, your AI thought partner. These topics can be nuanced, so if anything is unclear, or if you want to explore a specific ethical angle further, please ask. For instance, you might ask, 'Link, what's the most common ethical pitfall marketers accidentally fall into when using AI visuals for the first time?'"

We'll recap AI's power in visual creation and introduce the critical importance of ethical use, perhaps mentioning a brief, relevant real-world example of an ethical issue with AI visuals. We'll also preview lesson objectives.

**(Workbook Activity - Page F: "Ethical Scenario Warm-up"): **"Before we dive deep into the principles, let's warm up our ethical thinking. Turn to Page F in your workbook. You'll find a short scenario. Read it and jot down any initial ethical flags or concerns that come to your mind. We'll build on this thinking."

## 2. Copyright & Intellectual Property Issues

We will discuss the unclear and evolving legal landscape regarding AI content ownership. A key question is: Who owns AI-generated work? The user, developer, or is it public domain? Answers are complex and vary.

Crucially, we'll emphasize checking Platform Policies (Terms of Service) for each AI tool regarding commercial use rights, attribution requirements, and restrictions. We'll also discuss copyright infringement risks and how AI might generate visuals similar to existing work.

Best practices include keeping records of prompts/outputs, understanding tool licenses, and cautious use of reverse image search.

**(Workbook Reflection - Page G: "Checking Usage Rights"):** "On Page G in your workbook, think about an AI image tool you're interested in exploring (like Midjourney or Adobe Firefly). Note down one specific action you will take to understand its usage rights before incorporating its images into a commercial marketing campaign."

**Ask Link:** *"Link, can you summarize the general stance or common clauses found in the terms of service of major AI image platforms like Midjourney or DALL-E regarding commercial use of images generated on their free vs. paid subscription tiers?"* I can provide insights based on publicly available information and typical industry practices.

## 3. Addressing Bias & Avoiding Misinformation

(Workbook Reference: See Page H for Bias Mitigation & Misinformation Check Activities.)

Bias in AI Models & Outputs: We'll discuss the origins of bias (AI learns from biased data), resulting in stereotypical or skewed outputs. Creators have a responsibility to critically review for bias. Mitigation strategies include using inclusive, balanced prompts (e.g., "diverse group of people," "medical professionals of various backgrounds") and striving for fair representation. The impact of biased visuals harms brand reputation and perpetuates stereotypes.

**(Workbook Activity - Page H, Part 1: "Rewriting a Biased Prompt"):** "Let's put this into practice. Go to Page H in your workbook. You'll find a sample prompt that might inadvertently lead to biased visual results. Your task is to rewrite it to be more inclusive and explain the reasoning behind your changes."

**Misinformation & Deepfakes: **We'll cover the danger of creating realistic but fake content, and the potential for fraud, defamation, or misrepresenting reality. There's an ethical obligation to avoid creating intentionally deceptive content; intent matters. Best practices include prompts encouraging accuracy, careful inspection of outputs, diverse review teams, and refraining from creating deepfakes or deceptive content.

**(Workbook Activity - Page H, Part 2: "Misinformation Check"):** "Still on Page H, for the second part of the activity, describe the steps you would take to verify the authenticity of a highly realistic AI-generated image that claims to depict a real event or a product in a specific, verifiable setting before using it in a campaign."

**Ask Link:** *"Link, what are some publicly available resources or checklists I can use to help my team identify and mitigate potential bias when reviewing AI-generated visuals?"* or *"Link, are there emerging technologies or established methods that can reliably detect sophisticated deepfakes, and what are their limitations?"* I can point you to some general information and organizations working in this area.

## 4. Transparency & Disclosure

We'll explain why transparency matters: it builds trust and avoids misleading audiences who might perceive AI content as real if undisclosed.

Degrees of disclosure will be discussed: Hashtags/Watermarks (#AIart) for clearly artistic AI creations versus Explicit Statements ("Image created using AI") for content easily mistaken for real photos/videos. Context is key: the more realistic, the stronger the need for disclosure. Consider avoiding AI where authenticity is paramount.

Practical guidelines include evaluating context, considering platform norms and audience expectations, and using proactive disclaimers (on websites, in captions).

(Workbook Activity - Page I: "Drafting a Disclosure"): "Turn to Page I in your workbook. Your task is to draft a short, clear disclosure statement suitable for using an AI-generated image that illustrates a conceptual marketing idea on a company blog post. Think about clarity and conciseness."

**Ask Link:** *"Link, are there any industry-standard phrases, icons, or labeling conventions emerging for AI content disclosure that are becoming widely recognized and understood by audiences?"*

## 5. Case Study Discussion (Workbook Activity)

(Workbook Reference: See Page J for Ethical Dilemma Scenarios.)

"Theories and guidelines are important, but let's see how these ethical principles play out in practice with some challenging scenarios. Turn to Page J in your workbook. You'll find 1-2 short scenarios describing realistic (or real-world inspired, anonymized) ethical dilemmas involving AI-generated visuals in marketing or media."

Instructions for Workbook: "For each scenario presented on Page J, I want you to analyze it based on the principles we've discussed today. In the space provided, please consider and answer the following for each case:

1. What is the primary ethical concern or dilemma in this scenario?

2. What level of transparency or disclosure (if any) would be appropriate in this situation, and why?

3. What potential harm (to individuals, the brand, or society) could arise from the use of AI as described?

4. How does this scenario relate to the principles of copyright, bias, accuracy, or transparency we've covered in this lesson?" \
Link: "Engage critically with these. Often, there aren't easy 'right' or 'wrong' answers, but ethical marketing demands thoughtful consideration, prioritizing honesty, fairness, and respect for your audience. After you've worked through them in your workbook, you could even ask me, 'Link, for the [specific case study, e.g., 'AI-Generated News Imagery' case], what would be a best-practice approach for that organization to minimize ethical risks while still leveraging AI?' I can help you think through different perspectives based on our course materials."
