AI-Powered Video Creation

**Lesson Overview:** This lesson focuses on leveraging AI for video content, addressing the growing demand for video while overcoming traditional production barriers. You will be introduced to various AI video tools, understand their different approaches (e.g., text-to-avatar, text-to-video from script/text), and explore practical marketing use cases. The importance of clear scripting, storyboarding, and incorporating brand elements will be highlighted, culminating in a hands-on workbook activity. This module builds on the concept of repurposing content from text to visuals, which might be further explored in Module 4.

**(Workbook Reference: Please have your Module 3 Workbook open. Specific page numbers for activities will be referenced.)**

**Lesson 3.2 Learning Objectives:** By the end of this lesson and its associated workbook activities, you will be able to:

- Identify and describe the unique capabilities and use cases for marketing video creation using prominent AI video tools ([Synthesia](https://giblink.ai/ai-marketing-tools/synthesia/), [Lumen5](https://giblink.ai/ai-marketing-tools/lumen5/), [Pictory](https://giblink.ai/ai-marketing-tools/pictory/), [InVideo](https://giblink.ai/ai-marketing-tools/invideo/), etc.) based on workbook examples.

- Understand how different AI video tools approach content generation (e.g., text-to-avatar, text-to-video from existing text/script).

- Explain the importance of clear scripting, storyboarding, and outlining before using AI video tools.

- Apply practical steps (conceptually) to plan the creation of a basic marketing video using an AI video tool through a guided workbook exercise.

- Identify key aspects to review and refine in potential AI-generated video outputs (clarity, engagement, brand alignment).

- Recognize how AI video tools can support content repurposing strategies.

## 1. Welcome & Introduction

“Welcome to Lesson 3.2! We’re continuing our exploration into AI-driven media, now focusing on the dynamic world of video. AI-powered video tools can dramatically streamline production from script to screen and unlock entirely new creative possibilities. Video is vital for connecting with audiences, and AI is making high-quality video creation more accessible than ever. As always, I'm Link, your AI guide. Feel free to ask me questions like, 'Link, what's the average time saving marketers report when using AI for simple video creation, like turning a blog post into a short video, compared to traditional methods?' I can share some general industry observations.”

This section will cover video's importance in marketing, AI's role in democratizing video creation, and a preview of lesson objectives.

## 2. Introduction to AI-Powered Video Creation Tools

(**Workbook Reference:** See Page B for screenshots/descriptions of video tool interfaces and their typical outputs.)

We will discuss several tools. Synthesia generates videos with realistic AI talking avatars from text scripts, ideal for training or personalized messages. Expert notes emphasize consistency and script clarity. Lumen5 transforms text content like blog posts into short videos, best with well-structured text; visuals need review. Pictory creates short clips from longer sources like webinars, excelling at quick text-to-video; human review is crucial. InVideo is a more comprehensive editor with AI features like smart templates for social ads and demos. We'll also briefly mention others like RunwayML or Pika Labs for more experimental generative video. We will show use cases for each tool.

**Ask Link:** As we discuss these, you might ask, *"Link, for creating a series of short educational videos for YouTube, which AI video tool from our list would offer a good balance of ease of use for beginners and sufficient customization options for branding?"* or "*Link, what are some common limitations I might encounter with AI text-to-video tools regarding visual variety or the emotional expression conveyed by AI avatars?"* I can provide insights based on the typical strengths of these platforms.

## 3. The Foundation: Scripting and Storyboarding

We'll explain why a clear script or well-structured text source is essential for most AI video tools, as AI needs structured input to generate coherent video. The importance of outlining the video's message and flow, like a simple storyboard, will be emphasized. This helps identify necessary visuals, text, and CTAs before using the AI tool, ensuring clarity and engagement. We will also connect this to content repurposing – identifying key points from a blog post to include in the video.

**(Workbook Reflection - Page E):** "On Page E of your workbook, briefly explain in your own words why having a clear script or well-structured text is important before using an AI text-to-video tool like Lumen5 or Synthesia."

**Ask Link:** *"Link, can you suggest a simple 3-act structure (beginning, middle, end) that I could use for scripting a 60-second explainer video about a new software feature, which I plan to generate using an AI tool?"*

## 4. Hands-On Exercise Introduction: Creating Your First AI Video (Conceptually)

We will introduce the "Create Your First AI Video" activity in the workbook.

This will be a conceptual planning exercise. You will choose a sample script, (conceptually) select an appropriate AI video tool, predict the types of visuals the AI might generate or how an avatar might present it, and plan key customizations for branding and clarity. We will emphasize reviewing and reflecting on the potential output and its alignment with a marketing goal. We'll also briefly mention that prompt engineering principles can apply to video (e.g., describing avatar appearance/tone).

(Workbook Activity - Page D): "Let's now turn to Page D in your workbook to begin the 'Create Your First AI Video' planning activity. You'll select a script, think about the visuals an AI might choose or how an avatar would deliver it, and plan how you'd customize the output to fit your brand and message."

**Ask Link:** *"Link, if I'm repurposing a fairly technical blog post into a video for a general, non-technical audience, what's one key tip for adapting the script to be more video-friendly and engaging for that audience?"*

## 5. Wrap-Up & Next Steps

We'll recap the explored tools, use cases, the importance of scripting/storyboarding, and the conceptual video creation practice. We will encourage completing the workbook activity.

*“Great work exploring the landscape of AI video creation! As you can see, these tools offer fantastic ways to enhance your marketing with engaging video content, often more quickly and affordably than traditional methods. Remember that clear input in the form of scripts and an understanding of your goals are paramount. In our next lesson, Lesson 3.3, we'll address the crucial ethical considerations for responsibly deploying both the AI images and videos we've discussed. It’s vital to ensure our innovative efforts are also principled.”*
