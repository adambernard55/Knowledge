## Pricing

Canva operates on a **freemium** model.

## Expert Notes

Canva excels at democratizing design, making it an essential tool for marketers and teams without dedicated designers. While its AI features are powerful assistants, outputs (especially from Magic Write and the Image Generator) should be reviewed for brand alignment and accuracy. The Brand Kit is a non-negotiable feature for any organization focused on maintaining brand consistency.
