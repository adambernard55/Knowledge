**Expert Notes & Tips:** Synthesia is excellent for creating consistent, scalable talking-head style videos efficiently, especially for training or informational content. While avatars are realistic, viewers can usually tell they are AI. Ensure scripts are well-written and concise. Test different avatars and voices to find the best fit for your brand. Best suited for informational content rather than highly emotive or action-packed videos. Consider accessibility by always including captions.
