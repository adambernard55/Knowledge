* Researching topic clusters and identifying content gaps.  
* Analyzing competitor content strategies.

**Pricing Overview:** Subscription-based SaaS model. Offers tiered plans based on the number of queries (Content Editor, Audit, SERP Analysis) per month, user seats, and feature access (like Grow Flow). Plans typically start around $69-$89/month when billed annually. *Subject to change; check website for current pricing.*

**Expert Notes & Tips:** Surfer provides excellent data-driven guidance but avoid "stuffing" keywords just to hit score targets; focus on natural language and user intent. Use it as a guide, not a rigid rulebook. The Content Editor is powerful for optimizing during the writing process. Auditing existing content can yield quick wins. Excellent for ensuring content comprehensiveness against top competitors. Integrations streamline workflow significantly.
