## Conversica

**Summary:** Conversica provides AI-powered Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs) designed to automate routine yet critical business conversations across the customer lifecycle, primarily for marketing, sales, and customer success teams. These IVAs engage leads and customers in natural, two-way dialogue via email, SMS, and sometimes web chat to qualify leads, schedule meetings, follow up, and nurture relationships, freeing up human teams for higher-value activities.

**AI Focus:** Core AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and machine learning to understand human responses, conduct human-like conversations, determine intent, and decide on the next best action.

**Expert Notes & Tips:**

* Conversica's strength lies in its ability to automate human-like, persistent conversational follow-up at scale, which is difficult for human teams to achieve consistently.  
* Clearly define the goals and scope for your IVA (e.g., qualify MQLs, schedule demos).  
* Customize the IVA's persona and conversation flows to align with your brand voice and specific campaign objectives.  
* Ensure seamless integration with your CRM for efficient lead handoff and data synchronization.  
* Train your sales team on how to work effectively with the IVA and the leads it qualifies.  
* Regularly review IVA performance reports and conversation logs to identify areas for optimizing conversation flows or IVA responses.  
* It's crucial that the IVA provides a positive and helpful experience, even when a lead is not yet ready to buy. The handoff to a human should be smooth when appropriate.
