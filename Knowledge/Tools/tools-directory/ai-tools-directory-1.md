**Google Keyword Planner**

Google Keyword Planner is a free tool provided by Google Ads designed to help advertisers (and content creators) research keywords for their search campaigns. It allows users to discover new keyword ideas, see historical search volume data, and get forecasts for keyword performance.

Accuracy can vary by language and industry jargon. Define clear objectives for *why* you are tracking sentiment.

**Expert Notes & Tips:** The Headline Analyzer is a fantastic tool for making writers more conscious of the elements that make a headline effective. Don't obsess over achieving a perfect score of 100; focus on understanding the feedback (especially word balance and clarity) and using it to improve. Test multiple variations. Remember that context and audience matter – a high score doesn't guarantee success, but it improves the odds. The free version is incredibly valuable for quick checks.
