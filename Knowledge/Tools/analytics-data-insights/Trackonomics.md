**Category:** Affiliate Marketing, Data Aggregation & Analytics

Trackonomics is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help content publishers, brands, and agencies create, analyze, and optimize affiliate content at scale. It functions as a data management platform (DMP) for e-commerce affiliates, simplifying, scaling, and optimizing the content journey. Acquired by impact.com in March 2021, Trackonomics offers robust data aggregation, revenue attribution, and link automation capabilities to maximize affiliate marketing revenue.

**Key Features:**

* **Data Consolidation & Aggregation:** Pulls data from over 100 affiliate networks and ad platforms into a customizable BI dashboard for flexible reporting and analysis. It uses network API utilization and other data extraction methods to aggregate and normalize data.  
* **Revenue Attribution (Funnel Relay):** Tracks the entire customer journey from click to purchase, identifying how much each link or article is worth. This is achieved by implementing a script on the publisher's website that passes a unique Trackonomics ID through each click event.  
* **Link Automation & Rapid Link Generation:** The Trackonomics Publisher Extension (available on Google Chrome) allows users to create affiliate links across multiple networks with the touch of a button, without logging into each platform. It also offers a product linking API to create affiliate links from within a CMS.  
* **Content Discovery:** Helps users search for competing products and use aggregated metrics to identify advertisers with the best revenue opportunities. Publishers can also use the Publisher Extension's content discovery features.  
* **Link Scanning & Optimization:** Automatically detects and replaces broken or out-of-stock links to prevent lost revenue.  
* **Page Categories:** Uses a proprietary NLP algorithm to automatically assign categories to each page, allowing publishers to view which shopping categories perform best.  
* **Bot Click Detection:** Enhanced bot click detection through a partnership with DeviceAtlas to align click metrics more closely with impact.com.  
* **Amazon AutoTagger:** Allows page-level analytics from Amazon Associates, now compatible with LinkWrapper for sites using AMP without needing the Funnel Relay script.  
* **Integrations:** Offers an improved "Add Data Source" screen for adding and repairing integrations. Integrates with tools like Semrush and Amazon S3.
