Each number indicates conceptual progression.  
Here’s how current directories map to the new structure:

---

### **0_fundamentals/**

_(Existing “fundamentals”)_

**Purpose:** Introduce core AI concepts, terminology, and foundations.

Keeps:

- what-is-ai.md
- history-of-ai.md
- types-of-ai.md
- machine-learning-vs-deep-learning.md
- the-ai-stack.md
- generative-ai-overview.md
- ai-ethics-and-bias.md _(link to main ethics section)_

→ _Role: AI literacy level 101._

---

### **1_methods-and-systems/**

_(Merge “prompt-engineering,” “technical-ai,” and part of “generative-content”)_

**Purpose:** Explain how AI works and how users interact with it.  
Combines all the “how” content.

Subfolders possible if you want topical clarity:

```
methods-and-systems/
├── architectures-and-llms.md
├── embeddings-and-vectorization.md
├── training-and-finetuning.md
├── prompt-engineering-basics.md
├── prompt-frameworks.md
├── agentic-ai-overview.md
├── multimodal-ai.md
└── evaluation-and-performance.md
```

→ _Role: methods, interfaces, and architecture._

---

### **2_applications-and-industries/**

_(Merge “applications,” “ai-in-marketing,” and “generative-content”)_

**Purpose:** Practical guides showing **where and how AI is applied**.

Structure:

```
applications-and-industries/
├── marketing/
│   ├── ai-content-strategy.md
│   ├── personalization-and-predictive-ai.md
│   ├── future-of-ai-in-marketing.md
│   └── ethical-ai-in-marketing.md
├── business-operations/
│   ├── ai-in-automation.md
│   ├── ai-in-ecommerce.md
│   ├── ai-in-analytics.md
│   └── ai-in-crm.md
├── creative-industries/
│   ├── ai-text-visual-video.md
│   ├── ai-creative-workflows.md
│   └── maintaining-brand-voice.md
└── sector-overview.md
```

→ _Role: real-world value creation._

---

### **3_tools-and-platforms/**

_(Existing “tools” simplified)_

This section stays but can be slimmer and focus on **practical, not exhaustive lists**.

```
tools-and-platforms/
├── overview.md
├── writing-and-content-tools.md
├── visual-tools.md
├── analytics-tools.md
├── implementation-guides.md
└── workflow-templates.md
```

→ _Role: “how to work smarter with AI tools.”_

---

### **4_ethics-and-governance/**

_(Existing section kept as is — may absorb ai-ethics-and-bias.md from fundamentals)_

**Purpose:** Dedicated reference space for compliance, fairness, and human-AI collaboration.

```
ethics-and-governance/
├── responsible-ai-principles.md
├── data-privacy-and-compliance.md
├── bias-and-fairness.md
├── transparency-and-accountability.md
├── intellectual-property.md
└── human-ai-collaboration.md
```

→ _Role: policy and ethical guardrails._

---

### **5_future-trends/**

_(Keep, but more focused)_

Combine your forward-looking materials and research summaries.

```
future-trends/
├── emerging-ai-technologies.md
├── ai-agents-and-autonomous-systems.md
├── ai-and-immersive-media.md
├── the-widening-ai-value-gap.md
