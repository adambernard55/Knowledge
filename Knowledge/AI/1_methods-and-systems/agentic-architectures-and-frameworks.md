# Agentic AI Systems: Architectures, Frameworks, and Memory

## Overview

**Agentic AI** represents a paradigm shift from reactive, prompt-driven models to autonomous systems that can plan, reason, and act to achieve complex goals. For machine learning practitioners, building these systems is a natural evolution that leverages foundational skills in prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Large Language Model (LLM) integration.

This reference document provides a technical overview of the core components required to design, build, and deploy production-ready agentic systems. It covers foundational architectural patterns, leading development frameworks, and advanced memory systems.

## 1. From Reactive Models to Agentic Systems

The key distinction between a standard LLM application and an agentic system is the presence of **agency**â€”the ability to operate autonomously in a loop of perception, planning, and action.

| Feature | Reactive System (Standard LLM / RAG) | Agentic System |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Respond accurately to a single user prompt. | Achieve a multi-step, complex objective. |
| **Planning** | Minimal; follows the immediate instruction. | Decomposes a high-level goal into a sequence of actionable steps. |
| **Action** | Primarily text generation, sometimes with a single tool call (e.g., RAG retrieval). | Can select and execute a variety of tools (APIs, code interpreters, databases) dynamically. |
| **Memory** | Limited to the current conversation context window. | Employs both short-term (working) and long-term (persistent) memory to learn and adapt. |
| **Autonomy** | Low; requires explicit human input for each step. | High; operates in a continuous loop, making decisions and self-correcting without constant human guidance. |

## 2. Core Architectural Patterns

The behavior and reasoning of an AI agent are governed by its underlying architectural pattern. Choosing the right pattern is critical for balancing performance, cost, and complexity.

| Pattern | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses | Ideal Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ReAct (Reason and Act)** | The agent alternates between a "thought" step (reasoning about what to do next) and an "act" step (using a tool). This creates an iterative loop of thought -> action -> observation. | Simple to implement; effective for straightforward tasks where the next step is clear. | High token consumption and latency due to an LLM call at each step. Can get stuck in loops. | Simple chatbots, single-goal research tasks, basic tool use. |
| **Plan-and-Execute** | The agent first creates a complete, multi-step plan to achieve the goal. It then executes each step in sequence, often using smaller, more efficient models for the execution phase. | Lower cost and latency for complex workflows. More predictable and structured than ReAct. | The initial plan can be rigid and may fail if the environment changes unexpectedly. Requires a robust planning phase. | Multi-step data analysis, content generation pipelines, business process automation. |
| **Reflexion (Reflection and Self-Correction)** | An advanced pattern where the agent performs a task, then generates a critique of its own performance. It uses this linguistic feedback to refine its plan and retry the task, learning from its mistakes over multiple cycles. | Enables self-improvement and leads to higher accuracy on complex problems. Good for tasks with clear success criteria. | Slower and more computationally expensive. Requires a model capable of high-quality self-critique. | Complex code generation, mathematical problem solving, scientific research. |

## 3. Key Frameworks for Agent Development

Several open-source frameworks have emerged to simplify the implementation of these architectural patterns.

| Framework | Primary Focus | Key Features | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LangGraph** | Production-grade, stateful, multi-agent systems. | Built on LangChain; represents agents as nodes in a graph. Provides fine-grained control, state management (checkpoints), and excellent observability with LangSmith. | Building complex, reliable, and auditable agentic workflows for enterprise applications. |
| **CrewAI** | Rapid prototyping and role-based agent collaboration. | Intuitive, role-based abstraction (e.g., "Researcher," "Writer"). Simplifies the creation of multi-agent teams that delegate tasks and work together. | Content creation pipelines, research teams, and scenarios where agents can be conceptualized as a "team of specialists." |
| **AutoGen (Microsoft)** | Conversational multi-agent patterns and enterprise integration. | Flexible and extensible framework for complex agent collaboration. Now part of the unified Microsoft Agent Framework, with deep integration into Azure AI. | Research into complex agent interactions and building solutions within the Microsoft/Azure ecosystem. |

**Practitioner's Note:** It is recommended to master one framework at a time. Start with **CrewAI** for rapid prototyping and move to **LangGraph** for production-grade control and observability.

## 4. Advanced Agent Concepts: Memory Systems

For an agent to perform long-running or context-dependent tasks, it requires a memory system that extends beyond the LLM's limited context window.

### 4.1 Types of Agent Memory

| Memory Type | Description | Implementation Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Short-Term (Working) Memory** | Stores information relevant to the current task or conversation session. It is typically volatile and resets after the task is complete. | In-memory dictionaries, Redis caches, LangGraph's built-in state management. |
| **Long-Term Memory** | A persistent store of knowledge that the agent accumulates over time. This allows the agent to recall past interactions, learned facts, and user preferences across sessions. | **Vector databases** (for semantic search), **knowledge graphs** (for structured facts), traditional SQL/NoSQL databases. |

### 4.2 The Hybrid Memory Approach
The current best practice for production agents is a **hybrid memory system** that combines multiple strategies:
1.  **Semantic Retrieval:** Use a vector store to retrieve relevant past experiences or documents based on the similarity to the current situation.
2.  **Factual Recall:** Use a knowledge graph or a relational database to store and query structured information (e.g., user profiles, product specifications).
3.  **Summarization:** Use an LLM to periodically summarize conversation history, compressing it to fit into the context window while retaining key information.

## 5. Practical Implementation and Evaluation

Building agentic systems requires a portfolio of practical skills that can be demonstrated through targeted projects.

| Project Type | Description | Core Skills Demonstrated |
|---|---|---|
| **Autonomous Research Agent** | An agent that takes a complex question, autonomously searches multiple web sources, synthesizes the findings, and generates a cited report. | Tool use (web search APIs), state management (tracking visited URLs), RAG, and planning. |
| **Multi-Agent Content System** | A "crew" of agents with specialized roles (e.g., Researcher, Writer, Editor, Fact-Checker) that collaborate to produce a polished article from a single topic prompt. | Multi-agent orchestration, task delegation, and role-based prompting. |
| **Autonomous Data Analysis Agent** | An agent that connects to a database or CSV file, understands natural language queries about the data, writes and executes code (SQL, Python) to find insights, and generates visualizations. | Code generation and execution, self-correction (debugging code), and advanced tool use. |

## 6. The Role of the Machine Learning Practitioner

Developing agentic systems is a natural extension of existing ML skills.

| Existing ML Skill | Application in Agentic Systems |
|---|---|
| **Prompt Engineering** | Designing the system prompts, instructions, and role definitions that guide the agent's behavior and reasoning. |
| **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | Building the long-term memory systems that allow agents to retrieve and reason over private data. |
| **Model Fine-Tuning** | Fine-tuning smaller, specialized LLMs to act as efficient "worker" agents in a plan-and-execute or multi-agent system. |
| **MLOps** | Designing systems for observability (e.g., LangSmith), evaluation, and continuous deployment of agentic applications. |
