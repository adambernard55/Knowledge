# LLM and System Architectures: From Transformers to Agentic AI

## Overview

Understanding **AI architectures** involves looking at two distinct but interconnected layers: the **internal model architecture** that gives a Large Language Model (LLM) its capabilities, and the **external system architecture** that integrates the LLM into a functional application.

-   **Model Architecture:** The foundational design of the neural network itself, with the **Transformer** being the industry standard.
-   **System Architecture:** The practical pattern used to build an application around an LLM, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, or an agentic loop.

This reference document provides a technical overview of the Transformer architecture and explores the common architectural patterns used to build sophisticated, production-ready AI systems.

## 1. The Foundational Layer: The Transformer Architecture

The **Transformer**, introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need," is the neural network architecture that underpins virtually all modern LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Claude. Its core innovation is the **self-attention mechanism**, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input text when processing and generating language.

### Key Components of the Transformer

| Component | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Embeddings** | Word Representation | Converts input tokens (words or sub-words) into numerical vectors that capture their semantic meaning. |
| **Positional Encoding** | Sequence Information | Adds information about the position of each token in the sequence, as the self-attention mechanism itself does not process order. |
| **Self-Attention** | Contextual Weighting | The "brain" of the Transformer. For each token, it calculates an "attention score" to determine how much focus to place on all other tokens in the input when encoding its meaning. |
| **Multi-Head Attention** | Parallel Processing | Runs the self-attention mechanism multiple times in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input text simultaneously (e.g., one "head" might focus on grammatical structure, another on semantic relationships). |
| **Encoder-Decoder Structure** | Transformation & Generation | The **encoder** builds a rich numerical representation of the input text. The **decoder** takes this representation and generates the output text token by token. Many modern LLMs are "decoder-only," specialized for text generation. |
| **Feed-Forward Network** | Final Processing | A standard neural network layer applied after the attention mechanism to process the outputs further. |

## 2. Common Architectural Patterns for LLM Systems

While the Transformer is the engine, the system architecture is the vehicle built around it. The choice of architecture depends entirely on the task, required data, and performance trade-offs.

| Pattern | Description | Use Case | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Zero/Few-Shot Prompting** | The simplest architecture. The LLM is used directly with a well-crafted prompt, without external data or fine-tuning. | Quick tasks, brainstorming, simple content generation, classification. | Simple, fast to implement, low cost for single tasks. | Relies entirely on the model's pre-trained knowledge; cannot access private data; prone to hallucinations. |
| **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** | The LLM is connected to an external knowledge base (typically a vector database). When a query is received, the system first retrieves relevant documents and then passes them to the LLM as context to generate a "grounded" answer. | Q&A over private documents, customer support bots, internal knowledge search. | Access to up-to-date, private data; reduces hallucinations; more transparent and auditable. | Higher latency; complexity in the retrieval component; performance depends on the quality of the knowledge base. |
| **Fine-Tuning** | The weights of a pre-trained LLM are updated by training it on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. This specializes the model's behavior, style, or knowledge base. | Creating a chatbot with a specific brand voice, adapting a model to a niche domain (e.g., legal or medical terminology), improving reliability on a specific structured task. | Deeply embeds a specific style or knowledge; can improve performance on narrow tasks; potentially lower inference latency. | Expensive and time-consuming to create the dataset and run the training; risk of "catastrophic forgetting" of general knowledge. |
| **Agentic Architecture** | The LLM acts as the "reasoning engine" within a larger system. It can plan, use external tools (APIs, code interpreters), and operate in a loop to achieve a complex goal. | Autonomous task automation, complex research, data analysis, multi-step workflows. | Highly capable and flexible; can solve complex problems that require interaction with the outside world. | Highest complexity and cost; difficult to debug and control; requires robust safety and error handling. |

## 3. The Role of the LLM in Different Architectures

The LLM's function changes depending on the system it's embedded in.

-   **In Prompting:** The LLM is the **entire system**. Its pre-trained knowledge is the only resource.
-   **In RAG:** The LLM is a **synthesizer and reasoner**. Its primary job is to generate a coherent answer based on the provided context, not just its internal knowledge.
-   **In Fine-Tuning:** The LLM is a **specialized expert**. Its core behavior has been modified to excel at a narrow set of tasks.
-   **In Agentic AI:** The LLM is the **brain or orchestrator**. It plans and delegates tasks to other tools, acting as the central decision-making component.

## 4. Key Considerations for Choosing an Architecture

Selecting the right architecture involves balancing trade-offs between capability, cost, and complexity.

| Consideration | Zero-Shot / Prompting | RAG | Fine-Tuning | Agentic Systems |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Access to External Data** | None | Yes (Real-time) | No (Baked-in) | Yes (Real-time) |
| **Development Complexity** | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| **Cost (Development)** | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| **Cost (Inference)** | Low | Medium (due to larger context) | Low (if using smaller, tuned models) | High (due to multiple LLM calls) |
| **Latency** | Low | High | Low | High |
| **Controllability** | Low | Medium | High (for specific tasks) | Medium (can be unpredictable) |
| **Up-to-Date Knowledge**| No | Yes | No | Yes |

**General Heuristic:** Always start with **prompting**. If that fails because of knowledge gaps, move to **RAG**. If RAG fails because of reasoning or style issues, consider **fine-tuning**. If the task requires multi-step action, build an **agent**.

## 5. The Evolution of Model Architecture: Mixture of Experts (MoE)

A significant recent evolution in the internal architecture of LLMs is the **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** model. Instead of a single, monolithic neural network where all parameters are used for every token, an MoE model consists of:
-   A **router network** that directs input to the most relevant "expert."
-   Multiple smaller **expert networks**, each specialized in a different type of data or task.

For any given input, only a fraction of the experts are activated.

**Benefits of MoE:**
-   **Faster Inference:** Fewer total calculations are needed per token.
-   **Lower Training Cost:** Can be trained more efficiently than a dense model of the same size.
-   **Higher Parameter Count:** Allows for models with trillions of parameters while keeping inference costs manageable.

Models like Mistral's Mixtral 8x7B and Google's Gemini family use MoE architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency.

## 6. Key Takeaways

1.  **AI architecture exists at two levels:** the internal **model architecture** (like the Transformer) and the external **system architecture** (like RAG or agents).
2.  The **Transformer** and its self-attention mechanism are the foundation of modern LLMs, enabling them to understand context and sequence.
3.  Practitioners build systems around LLMs using patterns like **RAG** (for knowledge grounding), **fine-tuning** (for specialization), and **agentic loops** (for autonomous action).
4.  The choice of architecture is a **strategic trade-off** between capability, cost, complexity, and control. Always start with the simplest effective solution.
5.  Modern model architectures like **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** are pushing the boundaries of performance and efficiency, enabling more powerful and accessible AI systems.
