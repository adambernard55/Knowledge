Major Speed Up

Version 0.8.15 - Updated on December 14, 2023

### 

6x Faster Indexing

The Make.md **Superstate** is the indexer that keeps all your spaces and contexts updated while you make. The new Superstate is rebuilt from the ground up so that it can perform and scale no matter how big your system is. This update also solves various memory related issues from the previous cache. Here are some benchmarks we tested.

`Full Index - 800 Notes`

**Previous Superstate** - 1.5 Seconds

**New Superstate** - 0.2 Seconds

`Full Index - 30,000 Notes`

**Previous Superstate** - 30.9 Seconds

**New Superstate** - 5 Seconds

### 

New File Types, Tasks and More!

One of our main goals for Make.md is to allow your spaces to interact with any information in any file so that you're not limited to any specific organization. This update brings a new architecture that takes Make.md closer to that vision and in the next major release.

We will be introducing some new methods to cache and index inside your notes whether they're tasks or blocks in a note or to calculate information about your notes. If you have any ideas, we would love to hear them at [http://make.md/community](http://make.md/community)

### 

Building Your Perfect System

One of our favorite parts of the community is everyone's desire to create their own unique perfect system. We've redesigned the core of Make.md to be more adaptable to new use cases and customizations that we've seen shared in the community. We're also conscious that certain changes may not have the expected result so if something breaks or isn't working, don't hesitate to let us know.

Welcome to Make.md 0.8

Version 0.8.4 - Updated on October 29, 2023

### 

Re-Introducing Spaces 👋

Spaces have enabled **makers** from everywhere to organize and tailor their systems exactly the way they want. We've been inspired by the way the community has pushed the limits of what Spaces can be and this update is our reimagination of Spaces.

### 

New Ways to Organize 🍱

**Spaces** allow you to connect files across your system so you can stay focused and organized. Now, we have combined all the features of Spaces so you can use them in any folder.

**What's New in 0.8**

- You can now open any Folder as a Space and take advantage of all the features of Spaces
    
- Smart search to automatically add items.
    
- Add any item from your vault.
    
- Custom order for your space.
    

### 

Navigator 🧭

Redesigned from the ground up in 0.8, the **Navigator** helps you navigate your Spaces and manipulate them however you want.

**What's New in 0.8**

- Drag and Drop between Spaces to Move, Add or Copy items
    
- Add commonly used Spaces to Waypoints that you can quickly access
    
- Search your system and create a smart search to your Space.
    

### 

Build Structure with Contexts 📐

Contexts help you define a set of properties for your Space so that every item inside that Space will automatically get those properties. You can nest contexts together and create complex relationships.

**What's New in 0.8**

- Two way relationships between different contexts
    
- Nested Contexts - Add a tag context to a tag context and so on...
    
- Auto nested contexts for subtags
    

### 

Beautiful and Interactive 🖌️

Just like real-life spaces, we want to make our digital spaces beautiful, interactive and our own. When you open up a Space, you will see all the items in your Space in a handtuned list view as well as a note for add information to your Space. You will also be able to add buttons, progress bars and more to make your Space into an interactive Dashboard or a beautiful Start Page.

**What's New in 0.8**

- Customize the Space View exactly the way you want it
    
- Buttons, Resizable Images, Progress Bars and Columns
    
- Apply styles to your notes like custom fonts and sizing.
