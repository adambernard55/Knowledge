## The rise of Vibe Marketing: when execution meets imagination

By Thibault Imbert published September 4, 2025

### AI is collapsing the gap between ideas and execution

We're witnessing a fundamental shift in how marketing is done. The focus is not only on new tools or faster processes, but on the collapse of the barrier between having an idea and bringing it to life. This transformation has given birth to "Vibe Marketing": a new paradigm where thought and execution merge into one fluid, intuitive process.

What is Vibe Marketing?
Vibe marketing is a new approach to creating and executing campaigns that focuses on emotional connection and mood rather than traditional data-driven methods.

Rather than starting with keywords or demographics, vibe marketing begins with a feeling, whether it's a mood, a cultural reference, or a specific emotion, and uses AI tools to help translate that into visual and written assets.

The End of the Translation Layer
Traditional marketing has always suffered from a critical flaw: the handoff moment where brilliant ideas get translated into execution, and something inevitably gets lost in translation. The same applies to software development, where executing an idea often means accepting compromises.

Think about how many times you've had a crystal-clear vision in your mind, only to watch it degrade as it moves through the machinery of creation, from concept to brief, from brief to design, from design to final output.

This translation layer wasn't just inefficient, it was creatively destructive. Your taste and imagination were always there, but they were trapped behind technical barriers. Even when your mind could picture the perfect output, if your technical skills couldn't match your mental capabilities, the final result was hindered by the lowest common denominator of your execution abilities.

AI has eliminated this translation layer entirely. Instead of describing what you want through lengthy briefs and specifications, you can now communicate through a conversation. Show an image that captures the feeling you're after, and AI understands not just the literal elements but the emotional essence you're trying to convey, the vibe. The direct transfer from mind to screen has become reality.

The Courage Multiplier Effect
When execution becomes as cheap as thinking, something profound happens to creative courage. In the old model, mistakes were expensive because redoing work meant significant time and resource investment. This created what I call the "premature practicality filter", a mental mechanism that killed ideas in their infancy because you knew you couldn't execute them.

The psychological impact of this shift cannot be overstated. Ideas that would have been stifled in their early stages now have the chance to thrive and evolve.. When you don't have to immediately think "but how would I actually make this?" a whole category of previously self-censored concepts emerges. The cost of being wrong has dropped dramatically, which means the courage to be bold can increase proportionally.

This faster feedback loop between idea, result, and iteration fundamentally changes the relationship with failure. Instead of having to nail it upfront, you can afford to treat failure as information. You're not just doing the same marketing faster, you're thinking entirely different thoughts because the realm of the possible has expanded.

Creative Democracy and the Productivity Revolution
Vibe Marketing democratizes creativity in ways we're only beginning to understand. The people who could execute weren't necessarily the people with the best ideas, but technical barriers created a homogeneity problem that locked out diverse voices from the creative process. Now, anyone can contribute to and participate in marketing creation, bringing genuine creative autonomy to the masses.

This is about more than inclusion, it's about accessing untapped creative potential. Good ideas come from everywhere, but previously, those ideas were trapped in people who lacked the technical skills to execute them. When you remove those barriers, you don't just get more people doing marketing; you get more diverse thinking, more novel approaches, and potentially entirely new categories of marketing that we haven't seen before.

The productivity implications are staggering. Teams can now do dramatically more work because the time previously consumed by execution can be redistributed to ideation. You're not just working faster; you're working at a fundamentally different level of creative output. This becomes a powerful revenue and business driver, multiplying the creative capacity of entire organizations.

When Taste Becomes the New Intelligence
Here's where Vibe Marketing reveals its most counterintuitive truth: by making marketing easier, AI has actually made it harder to stand out. When everyone has access to the same powerful execution tools, technical skill is no longer the differentiator. What separates good marketing from great marketing in this new landscape?

This creates a fascinating paradox. The democratization of execution has inadvertently created a meritocracy of taste. The people who win aren't the ones with the best technical skills anymore, they're the ones with the best aesthetic judgment and conceptual thinking. When execution becomes effortless, taste becomes the new intelligence.

Unlike technical skills, taste cannot be taught or systematized, it must be acquired through exposure and experience. This means that while AI has democratized the technical barriers, it may have actually made the remaining barrier more exclusive because taste is fundamentally personal and experiential.

The implications are profound. We may be heading toward a world where marketing becomes more stratified by taste quality rather than technical ability. Those who have developed sophisticated aesthetic judgment through years of exposure to great work will have an increasingly significant advantage over those who haven't.

The Speed of Thought Marketing
When you can execute any idea instantly, does that accelerate taste development? The answer appears to be yes. The ability to test aesthetic instincts rapidly means you can acquire taste faster than ever before. You can experiment with different visual approaches, try various conceptual frameworks, and iterate through multiple creative directions in the time it would have previously taken to execute a single idea.

This creates a compounding effect. Better taste leads to better creative choices, which can now be executed immediately, leading to faster learning and even better taste development. It's a virtuous cycle that accelerates creative growth in ways we've never seen.

Vibe Marketing represents marketing that has finally caught up to human imagination. For the first time in the medium's history, marketing can move at the speed of thought rather than the speed of technical implementation. Ideas can flow directly from conception to reality without degradation, compromise, or delay.

The Future of Creative Expression
We're entering an era where the boundary between thinking and doing has dissolved. Execution has become part of the ideation process rather than separate from it. This represents a new way of doing marketing, one that redefines the relationship between imagination and reality.

The marketers who will thrive in this new landscape aren't necessarily those with the most technical knowledge or the biggest budgets. They're the ones with the most refined taste, the most courageous creative instincts, and the deepest understanding of what resonates with human emotion and desire.

Vibe Marketing is more than just the tools we use, it's about a fundamental shift in how creative work gets done. It's about working in a world where your aesthetic judgment and conceptual thinking are your only competitive advantages. It's about marketing that moves at the speed of vibes, where the gap between inspiration and manifestation has finally collapsed.

The question isn't whether this transformation will continue, it's how quickly you'll adapt to a world where execution is no longer the bottleneck, and creativity is the only currency that matters.
