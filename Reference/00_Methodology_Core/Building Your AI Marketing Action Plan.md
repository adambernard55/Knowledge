# Lesson 9.2: Crafting Your AI Marketing Action Plan with STRIVE (20 mins + Workbook)

**Objective:** To guide you through the process of developing your personalized AI Marketing Action Plan using the consolidated "AI Marketing Action Plan Workbook & Toolkit," with a strong emphasis on using the STRIVE framework for tool selection.

This lesson is where you start building! We'll walk through the **AI** Marketing Action** Plan Workbook & Toolkit (PDF)**. The goal is to structure your thinking, prioritize effectively, and plan a realistic first step into implementing AI. Remember the philosophy: **Start small, measure, learn, and iterate.**

**Download the "AI Marketing Action Plan Workbook & Toolkit" now from the course resources.**

Let's walk through each section of the Workbook:

## Part 1: Identifying Your AI Opportunities

**Identify & Prioritize Marketing Challenges:**

**Guidance:** Brainstorm your top 3-5 marketing challenges. Think about bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or areas where you're falling short of goals. Then, prioritize! Which 1-2 challenges offer the **biggest potential impact** if addressed with AI **and** seem feasible to tackle first? Don't try to solve everything at once.

**Workbook Prompt Example:** *"List* your top marketing challenges. Rank them by* potential impact and feasibility for an initial AI pilot."* (Refer to Workbook Section 1.1)

## Part 2: Selecting Your Tools Strategically with STRIVE

**Select Initial AI Tools using the STRIVE Framework:**

**Guidance:** Based on your prioritized challenge(s) and the recap in Lesson 9.1, identify 1-2 specific AI tools you want to explore for your pilot project. This is where the **STRIVE Framework** becomes your critical evaluation guide. For each potential tool, meticulously assess it against all six STRIVE criteria:

- **S** -** Strategic Fit & Alignment:** Does this tool directly address my prioritized challenge? Does it align with my brand and long-term marketing goals? Is it a significant improvement?

- **T - Technical Efficacy & Performance:** Is the tool proven and reliable? What do reviews say about its accuracy and capabilities for tasks similar to mine? Is the underlying tech sound?

- **R - ROI & Scalability:** What's the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)? What's the potential ROI (time saved, conversions increased, costs reduced)? Can it scale if my pilot is successful?

- **I - Integration & Usability:** Will it integrate with my current tech stack? Is it user-friendly for my team, or is there a steep learning curve? How easy is data import/export?

- **V - Vendor Viability & Support:** Is the vendor reputable and financially stable? What kind of support, documentation, and training do they offer? What's their product roadmap?

- **E - Ethical & Compliance Alignment:** How does the tool handle data (privacy, security, GDPR/CCPA)? What are its bias mitigation measures? Is the vendor transparent?

**Workbook Integration:** Your workbook (Section 2.1) has a dedicated table for you to systematically apply the STRIVE criteria to your potential tool choices.

**Consider:** Free/freemium options for initial piloting if budget is a concern, but *still evaluate them rigorously through the STRIVE lens.*

**Workbook Prompt Example:** *"For* your* top priority challenge, list 1-2 AI tools you will investigate. For each, complete the STRIVE Evaluation table. Based on this assessment, justify your final tool choice for the pilot project."* (Refer to Workbook Section 2.1)

## Part 3: Designing Your AI Pilot Project

**Outline Your Pilot Project:**

- **Guidance:** This is crucial. Define a **Minimum Viable AI Project** – a small, focused, measurable test you can realistically execute in the next 30-60 days using your STRIVE-selected tool.

- **Examples:** "Use [Selected AI Tool 1 based on STRIVE] to generate social media captions for one upcoming campaign," "Implement [Selected AI Tool 2 based on STRIVE]'s AI send-time optimization for the monthly newsletter," "Set up a basic FAQ chatbot using [Selected AI Tool 3 based on STRIVE] for website visitors."

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"Describe your pilot project in 1-2 sentences. What specific AI function, using your selected tool, will you test?"* (Refer to Workbook Section 3.1)

**Define SMART Success Metrics:**

- **Guidance:** How will you know if your pilot is successful? Use the SMART framework: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, **T**ime-bound.

- **Examples:** "Increase click-through rate on the newsletter subject lines (optimized by [AI Tool]) by 10% within 3 months," "Reduce time spent writing social captions (using [AI Tool]) by 25% in the first month," "Generate 10 qualified leads via the [AI Chatbot Tool] in the first 60 days." Avoid vague goals like "Improve engagement."

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"List 1-3 SMART metrics to measure the success of your pilot project."* (Refer to Workbook Section 3.2)

**Assess Resource Needs:**

- **Guidance:** Be honest. What do you need?

- **Budget:** Any subscription costs for tools? Ad spend for PPC pilots?

- **Time:** How many hours per week for setup, learning, execution, analysis?

- **Team:** Who needs to be involved? Do they need training?

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"Estimate the budget, time commitment (per week/month), and personnel required for your pilot."* (Refer to Workbook Section 3.3)

**Create a Flexible Timeline:**

- **Guidance:** Break your pilot project into simple phases with target completion dates. Be realistic and build in buffer time.

- **Example Phases:** Tool Research & STRIVE Evaluation (Week 1), Tool Setup & Familiarization (Week 1-2), Implementation/Testing (Weeks 2-4), Data Collection (Weeks 2-5), Analysis & Reporting (Week 6).

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"Outline a brief timeline with key milestones for your pilot project (e.g., Weeks 1-6)."* (Refer to Workbook Section 3.4)

## Part 4: Ensuring Responsible Implementation

**Discuss Ethical Implications & Compliance:**

- **Guidance:** Actively consider the ethical dimension (Module 8). Does your project involve sensitive data? Is there potential for bias in the tool or its application? How will you ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance with regulations like GDPR/CCPA? Your STRIVE evaluation (specifically the 'E' criterion) for the chosen tool should heavily inform this section.

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"Briefly* describe any ethical considerations* (data privacy, bias, transparency, compliance) related to your pilot project and how you will address them. Refer to your STRIVE evaluation notes for the chosen tool."* (Refer to Workbook Section 4.1)

**Address Potential Risks & Mitigation:**

- **Guidance:** What could go wrong? (e.g., Tool is harder to use than expected, results aren't significant, ethical concerns arise, integration issues). How will you handle it? (e.g., Allocate extra learning time, have a backup plan, conduct an ethical review before launch, consult vendor support).

- **Workbook Prompt Example:** *"Identify 1-2 potential risks for your pilot project and suggest a mitigation strategy for each."* (Refer to Workbook Section 4.2)

## Part 5: AI Implementation Toolkit (Integrated into the Workbook)

The consolidated workbook also includes sections adapted from the "Your AI Implementation Toolkit" (now Part 5 of your workbook), such as:

- Best Practices Checklist for Launching an AI Marketing Initiative.

- SMART Metric Examples.
