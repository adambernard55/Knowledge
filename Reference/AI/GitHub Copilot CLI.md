Menu. Currently selected:Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 support

Weâ€™ve had an exciting week since our initialÂ [public preview release last week](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-25-github-copilot-cli-is-now-in-public-preview/). Weâ€™ve shippedÂ [numerous improvements](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases)Â to GitHub Copilot CLI which wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the great engagement and feedback from our preview users. Thank you, and keep it coming!

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new this week.

## [Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 support](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-support)

Claude Sonnet 4.5, Anthropicâ€™s most advanced model for coding and real-world agents, is now available in public preview in GitHub Copilot CLI. Weâ€™reÂ [gradually rolling it out](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-29-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-is-in-public-preview-for-github-copilot/)Â to Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise users.

## [Choose your model with ease](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#choose-your-model-with-ease)

You now have direct control over which AI model powers your CLI sessions. Use the newÂ `/model`Â slash command to quickly switch between available models. Your selected model is displayed above the input box, so you always know which model youâ€™re working with.

## [Image recognition](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#image-recognition)

UsingÂ `@`Â and mentioning images makes them available to the model as input.

## [Directly execute shell commands](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#directly-execute-shell-commands)

Prepend your input withÂ `!`Â to directly execute it in your shell, without making a call to the model.

![GIF of a terminal where "!git clone https://github.com/github/copilot-cli" has been typed. Instead of making a call to the model, the Copilot CLI executes the command directly in the shell](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee65ca6c-26cf-4fe9-bc41-ac5896ff9334)

## [Refined interface and navigation](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#refined-interface-and-navigation)

Weâ€™ve polished the CLI experience with thoughtful improvements:

- **Smarter input handling**: The input box now scrolls and limits to 10 lines, keeping your screen clean even with longer prompts. Weâ€™ve also improved word motion and multiline navigation so arrow keys behave exactly as youâ€™d expect. These are stepping stones on the way to supportingÂ [multiline input](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/14), a heavily requested feature.
- **Better visibility**: Timeline events for file operations are now more dense with information.
- **Scrolling list navigation**: A new scrollbar appears in pickers to help you navigate large lists.
- **Session management improvements**: TheÂ `--resume`Â session picker now displays relative timestamps and message counts, making it simple to jump back into recent conversations. Weâ€™ve also shipped aÂ `--continue`Â flag to continue from your last session.

- **Streamlined layout**: We removed unnecessary borders and improved spacing throughout the interface, making it easier to copy text and stay focused on your session.

- **More legible Markdown**: Weâ€™ve excludedÂ `#`Â prefixes from Markdown rendering for a more readable experience.

## [Fine-grained permission control](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#fine-grained-permission-control)

Take precise control over what Copilot CLI can execute with enhanced tool permissions. You can now use glob patterns inÂ `--allow-tool`Â andÂ `--deny-tool`Â flags to match command patterns. For example,Â `shell(npm run test:*)`Â allows any test script while keeping tighter restrictions on other operations. This gives you the flexibility to integrate Copilot CLI securely into your existing workflows.

Weâ€™ve improved shell command path extraction to ensure youâ€™re always prompted for permission when Copilot CLI wishes to access a new directory. In addition, weâ€™ve enhanced our parsing of PowerShell commands.

## [Context and usage statistics](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#context-and-usage-statistics)

How many premium requests have you used this session? Are you getting close to filling the modelâ€™s context? Weâ€™ve made improvements to help you answer these questions and give you insight into your usage.

- **`/usage`Â command**: TheÂ `/usage`Â slash command informs you of how many premium requests youâ€™ve used this session, how long your session has been, how many lines of code youâ€™ve edited, and gives a break down of token usage for each model. The same information will be printed at the conclusion of your session.
- **Truncation notification**: Copilot CLI truncates the modelâ€™s context when its token limit is reached. When youâ€™re getting close to truncation (â‰¤ 20% context remaining), a warning will display above the input box.

## [Enterprise and authentication improvements](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#enterprise-and-authentication-improvements)

Weâ€™ve strengthened support for enterprise environments:

- Copilot CLI now uses per-subscription API endpoints in accordance withÂ [GitHubâ€™s network access management guidelines](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-access/manage-network-access).
- Clearer error messages when Copilot CLI is blocked by organization policy or when using a PAT missing theÂ `Copilot Requests`Â permission.
- Fixed bugs inÂ `/user`Â commands to correctly show users across all authentication modes.

## [Share your feedback](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#share-your-feedback)

Update GitHub Copilot CLI by runningÂ `npm install -g @github/copilot@latest`Â in your terminal. Thank you to everyone who has submitted feedback via theÂ `/feedback`Â command and by opening issues inÂ [our public repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli). Your continued feedback is invaluable as we continue to ship improvements daily.
